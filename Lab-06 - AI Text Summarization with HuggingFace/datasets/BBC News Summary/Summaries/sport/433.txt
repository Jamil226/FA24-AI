The match was a re-run of last week's final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him all the way.Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set."After those first three games it was no match at all.I don't know, it was really weird.World number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3.I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court."

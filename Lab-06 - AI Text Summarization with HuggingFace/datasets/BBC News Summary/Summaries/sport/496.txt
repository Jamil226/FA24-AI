- Former world number two Tommy Haas is also a doubt for the Australian Open after picking up a thigh injury playing for Germany in the Hopman Cup.Mark Philippoussis is almost certain to miss the Australian Open after suffering a groin injury during the Hopman Cup loss to the Netherlands.The Australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event."The injury is more common in Australian Rules football, and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although Mark's injury is slightly different."He is now unlikely to be fit in time for the Australian Open which begins on 17 January in Melbourne."He has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis," said Hopman Cup doctor Hamish Osborne.

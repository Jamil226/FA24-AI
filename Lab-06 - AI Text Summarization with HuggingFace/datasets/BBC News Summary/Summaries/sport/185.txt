Bolton boss Sam Allardyce has signed Roma defender Vincent Candela on a five-month deal."In light of what has happened to Nicky Hunt, with his injury, it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back," Allardyce said."He has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the World Cup in 1998."He has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the Premiership.

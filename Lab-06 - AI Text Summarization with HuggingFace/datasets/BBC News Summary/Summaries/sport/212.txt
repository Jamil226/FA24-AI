A fresh start for the Scottish national team was imperative and Smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands.Scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level, so Smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources.The worst kept secret in Scottish football was revealed on Thursday when Walter Smith was named as the new national manager.Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents.But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager.The man who was Alex Ferguson's assistant when Scotland played at the 1986 World Cup won seven league titles with Rangers.Much was made of Vogts' inability to express himself to the players and media.And it remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts' preparation work.

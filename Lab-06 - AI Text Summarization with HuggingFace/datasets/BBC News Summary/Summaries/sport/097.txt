Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: "I don't think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas.An angry Beattie initially said: "He (Gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if I had headbutted him.The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday's match, insisting Gallas "would have stayed down a lot longer" if he had headbutted him, has now apologised.I thought it was a push initially and I still don't think it was a sending-off."Moyes continued: "Although the incident was totally out of character - James has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates."He was stopping as we were running and I said to myself 'if you're going to stay in my way I'll go straight over you'."James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done.We were chasing a ball into the corner and William Gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off.

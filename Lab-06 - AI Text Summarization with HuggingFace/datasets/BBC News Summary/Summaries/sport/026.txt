Sprinter Michelle Collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport.Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation.The 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal.

Scotland manager Walter Smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the Home International series."So I would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule."The Home International series was done away with in 1984, with the traditional Scotland-England fixture continuing until 1989.But Smith said: "Bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed.""The Scotland v England match was a highlight of the end of the season," he added.If you don't, they can be de-motivating.

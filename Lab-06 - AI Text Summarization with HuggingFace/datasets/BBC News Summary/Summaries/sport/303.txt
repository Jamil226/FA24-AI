Jones was happy to hail Henson's heroic contribution to Wales' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993.Wales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England."I looked at where it was and I knew I was going to struggle to make it," Jones added."Physically he's a specimen: he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well," Jones said."I'm the sort of player who likes pressure on me," he said."I knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me," Jones said.He was confident and fancied it."I set a high standard against England and I've got to back it up next week."His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game.Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff."I said to Gareth (Thomas, the Wales captain) 'This is touch and go.'"Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn't involved and we lost, so we've got to put that right next week."

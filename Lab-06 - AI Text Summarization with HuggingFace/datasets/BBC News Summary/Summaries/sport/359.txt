Wales coach Mike Ruddock says John Yapp has what it takes as an international.Ruddock hopes that the selection of Yapp and Dragons lock Ian Gough - out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach Steve Hansen - will send a message to other players in Wales.Ruddock's assessment was backed up by Yapp's coach at the Blues, former Wales and Lions prop Dai Young.The 21-year-old Blues prop is the only uncapped player in Wales' Six Nations squad, gaining a chance in the absence of Ospreys loose-head Duncan Jones.He has been playing with the Blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock," said Ruddock."He's working hard on his scrummaging technique, which he is keen to improve to become a destroyer on the loose-head."John is a young man with a big future."John's been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength," Young told BBC Sport Wales.

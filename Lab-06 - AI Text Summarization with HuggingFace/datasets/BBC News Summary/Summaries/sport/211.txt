Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu.Arsenal's Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract.He told BBC Sport: "I'm not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far.I want to sort it out as soon as possible, that's in the best interests of both the club and myself.Edu said: "I've just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested.Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire."That's nice, but I've never talked to them, so I can't say they want me sign 100%."

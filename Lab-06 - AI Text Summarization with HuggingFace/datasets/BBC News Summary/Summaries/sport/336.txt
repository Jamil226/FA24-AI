England forward Martin Corry says Jason Robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways."There are a lot of changes taking place with England and we are at the start of something."They are full of confidence and are playing a great team game," he said.But Corry insists England are in the right frame of mind for the contest.Every week my respect for him goes up," Corry told BBC Radio Five Live."Lansdowne Road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage."But Corry has backed Robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, ahead of this weekend's trip to Ireland.It's an honour to be in the England side and an honour to play under him.""We have not performed but if we put in a performance on Sunday then we can start turning results around.England are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their Six Nations campaign.

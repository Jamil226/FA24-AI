Sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if Farrell did decide to move to rugby union.The 27-year-old, who captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of Farrell would be a challenge.St Helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward Sonny Bill Williams, and Sculthorpe said he would love the 19-year-old to come to Knowsley Road.Sculthorpe was vice-captain in the Tri-Nations, and took the St Helens captaincy from Chris Joynt last year.Paul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union."The way he's looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then he's willing to do that."It's a short career and you have to make of it what you can," said Sculthorpe.Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play."Andy would be a hard act to follow but it's something I'm confident of being up to," he said."He's a great player - a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence, but who is also very skilful," he said.

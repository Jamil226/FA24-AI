With so much time spent in the spotlight, Holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt.Four months later, Holmes stormed to double Olympic gold and has since been made a Dame, won the BBC Sport Personality of the Year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes."You don't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double Olympic champion," agreed Cram.Athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look Kelly Holmes tearing up the track again.The physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for Holmes, who has already admitted she "doesn't like the training anymore."So, why is Holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again?Holmes has now pulled out of this weekend's European Indoor Championships, where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m, because of a hamstring injury.At 34, Holmes will also be aware that time is running out.Holmes' drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed.Holmes asked in the New Year.Holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten.Last April, Kelly Holmes spoke to the BBC Sport website about her loneliness, her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the Olympics.It just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them."Kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions, whether she can be competitive, if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line."I think deep down Kelly wants to run.And when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead, the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the "don't know" box.

Top seed Guillermo Coria went out of the Heineken Open in Auckland on Thursday with a surprise loss to Olivier Rochus of Belgium.Coria lost the semi-final 6-4 6-4 to Rochus, who goes on to face Czech Jan Hernych, a 6-4 7-5 winner over Jose Acasuso of Argentina.Coria conceded that Rochus "played just too good," and added: "When you give your best out there you can't be too sad."Rochus made the semi-finals at the Australian hardcourt championships in Adelaide last week and is naturally delighted with his form.

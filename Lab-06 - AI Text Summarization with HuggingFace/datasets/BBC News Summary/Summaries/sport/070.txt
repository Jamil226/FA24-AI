Yelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham.From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great.World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes.She had a go but just could not hang in there.From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.She looked good and was very positive.But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape.Apparently, Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time.Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly.Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money.Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition.He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly.As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti.

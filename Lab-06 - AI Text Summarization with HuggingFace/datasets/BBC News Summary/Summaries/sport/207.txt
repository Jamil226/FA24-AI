Tottenham sporting director Frank Arnesen has denied that coach Jacques Santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at White Hart Lane."When it comes down to personal problems, I don't think we should talk about timing," he said.He is the one who said 'I will go' and so he went'", said the Spurs sporting director."I think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at White Hart Lane and Santini," Stevens told Five Live.Arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused Santini to quit after just 13 games in charge."He has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself."But Frank Arnesen was a very creative, forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas I think Santini was very much the opposite, more a case of being organised, disciplined and happy not conceding goals.Tottenham's structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and Arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.I am confident that we have started something here in July and I still have a lot of confidence in Tottenham and what we are doing," he said."It is absolutely not true," Arnesen told BBC Radio Five Live.

Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: "Do I blame myself for the third goal?Kolo Toure's late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: "The only positive is that we are still in the tie."It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances.My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal."I just know the goals were very easy against us."Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf."In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens.Goalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: "We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment."

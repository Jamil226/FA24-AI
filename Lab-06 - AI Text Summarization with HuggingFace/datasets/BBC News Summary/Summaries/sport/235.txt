I don't go into that game."The managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game."But that is not only after a game, it is as well before a game."Arsene Wenger has stepped up his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson by claiming the Manchester United manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute.But in England you are only punished for what you say after the game.The pair's long-running row was put back in the headlines on Saturday when Ferguson said his Arsenal counterpart was "a disgrace".Maybe it is just Manchester United, they don't lose many games to other teams.Wenger later accused Van Nistelrooy of "cheating" and was fined Â£15,000 and "severely reprimanded" by the Football Association.Reminded that Ferguson called him "a disgrace", Wenger added: "I don't respond to anything."In the tunnel Wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so I told him to leave them alone and behave himself," Ferguson said on Saturday.It is 'bringing the game into disrepute'.Those allegations were put to Wenger after Saturday's game at Bolton, which Arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind Chelsea in the title race.But now he claims Ferguson should be punished by the Football Association.But Ferguson added: "In the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from Arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense.United won 2-0 that day, at Old Trafford, but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw Ferguson's clothes covered in soup and pizza.The latest twist in the Ferguson-Wenger saga came on Saturday when the United boss, in an interview with The Independent newspaper, discussed the events after the game between the two sides in October."Wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit," he added.It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person."I am a football manager and I love football above all ... no matter what people say.""The situation (concerning the food fight) has been judged and there is a game going on in a month.

Arsenal's Sol Campbell has called the rivalry between Manchester United and the Gunners "bitter and personal".I'm starting a little with French, of course."With tensions spilling over afterwards - United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players' tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on."After all that has happened, if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins, especially because of how we lost to them up there.""Everyone at Arsenal has been waiting for this game," said Campbell."It is just more bitter and personal against United," the defender told The Guardian newspaper."We are up for this one."

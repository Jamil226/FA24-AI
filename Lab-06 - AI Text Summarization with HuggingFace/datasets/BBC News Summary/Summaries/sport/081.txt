Kenteris, who won Olympic 200m gold at the 2000 Olympics, and Thanou were suspended by the IAAF last December after failing to take routine drugs tests before the Athens Games.Segas said the IAAF appeal was "expected" and "understandable."An IAAF statement said: "The Doping Review Board concluded that the decision is erroneous."Now the IAAF will lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and has suspended both athletes.Kenteris and Thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer's Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.The International Association of Athletics Federations will appeal against the acquittal of Greek athletes Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou.Thanou and Kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accidentIt was the International Olympic Committee who demanded the IAAF investigate the affair.

"The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup."They cannot speak to us about blips because they're not in a better position than us," Mourinho said."In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea.""We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we're out of the FA Cup but I don't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat.Mourinho's side were knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle last Sunday before seeing Barcelona secure a 2-1 Champions League first-leg lead in the Nou Camp.Mourinho said it was important to keep his team's results in perspective.

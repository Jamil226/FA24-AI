The Football Association will take no action against Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho following his sending-off in Sunday's Carling Cup final.Mourinho still faces an FA investigation into his allegation that Manchester United's players 'cheated' during January's Carling Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge.And a charge of failing to control their supporters following a Carling Cup meeting with West Ham earlier this season is still to be heard.Mourinho claimed his 'silence' gesture was aimed at the media, although they were on the other side of the ground.Mourinho, who was sent from the touchline for appearing to taunt Liverpool fans, has been "reminded of his responsibilities to the game".

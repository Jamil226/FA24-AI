Despite not playing for England, Wilkinson is still hoping to make the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward has not set a deadline for when Wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection.But Rob Andrew, coach of Wilkinson's club side Newcastle, said that with only two games left to play Wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time.That game is the day after England play Italy in the Six Nations and six days before their final match of the championship against Scotland.England's World Cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship.Wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the Zurich Premiership match against Harlequins on 13 March.

"It cost us the game against Wales but it has improved."It can be frustrating but I've had a lot more game time this season and I'm ready for it," Stevens said.Robinson has confirmed that fly-half Charlie Hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against France.Despite joining the squad, the Leicester flanker only has a "slim" chance of playing because of an infection in his finger.Lewis Moody has flown to Dublin to join England's camp ahead of their RBS Six Nations game against Ireland on Sunday."The chances of him playing are very slim," said coach Andy Robinson.The 22-year-old has only made 10 starts for his club but has made 49 appearances from the bench.If he fails to recover in time for the game, his place at the back of the pack will be taken by Andy Hazell.Chris Jones will then start the game on the bench."In each game we've missed a number of line-outs," he added.Robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with Bath prop Matt Stevens coming in for the injured Phil Vickery.

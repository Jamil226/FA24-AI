I would keep Gerrard.But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: "I sincerely hope he will be."I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else.Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: "I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.On the subject of Liverpool's finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future.Steven knows my views.I think it would be remiss not to.But we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep Steven against his will."We didn't had an offer last summer," Parry explained.I would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East.He said: "They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale."Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term."You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will.There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard."Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda.And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen.Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell."I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating.£50m for Gerrard?He told BBC Five Live: "Steven is above money.He is the future of Liverpool."We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him.

Former Southampton manager Gordon Strachan has rejected the chance to become Portsmouth's new boss."I think it's a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the Southampton manager," Strachan told the BBC."There's lots to do but it's not right for somebody who has just been the Southampton manager."Club director Terry Brady held initial talks with Strachan on Saturday.Strachan left St Mary's in February, after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the 2003-04 season.

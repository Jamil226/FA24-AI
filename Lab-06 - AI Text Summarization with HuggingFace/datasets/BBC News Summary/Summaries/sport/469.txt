"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him."Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way.Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia.And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: "The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset."What a great way to finish the year," said Nadal afterwards."But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff," said McEnroe.Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium."It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world," said the American."I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better."

Although the move would be a lucrative one for both Farrell and Wigan, Lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club.Lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up Farrell."As well as the Rugby Football Union, the league, the individual club and the England coaching team have a say, so it's not a quick decision," he said."But he's a very loyal friend to the club, so there's no question that he's deserting us.Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay says he does not expect a quick solution to the on-going saga of captain Andy Farrell's possible switch to rugby union."A shortage of money has never been a problem for us."It came as a bolt out of the blue to us," admitted Lindsay.Leicester and Saracens are leading the chase for the player, but Lindsay told the BBC it was not yet a done deal.

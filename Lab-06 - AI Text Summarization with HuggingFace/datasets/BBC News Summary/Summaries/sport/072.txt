When I'm at home, I get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days I was in London, I was in a pressurised situation, but I found it easy to relax by running.The bid chairman, Lord Coe, admitted he would never dream of running a marathon, even though he was an Olympic middle-distance runner.When I was in London I did all of my runs on the treadmill, which isn't the same as exercising outdoors.But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson, who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times.It was good to get out on the road for my long run on Sunday.Even though it was a very busy week entertaining the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Evaluation Commission, I actually found my running schedule easier to follow.And because it was a rest day I didn't have to feel bad about missing my training either.It was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to London's 2012 Olympic bid.But I coped with it very well and, even though it was bitterly cold, I put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then.After the week I'd had I was a bit concerned I wouldn't be able to complete it.

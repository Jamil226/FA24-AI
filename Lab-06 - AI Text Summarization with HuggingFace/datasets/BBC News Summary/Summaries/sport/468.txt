Agassi was delighted with victory over Massu in his first match for over two months."I liked the way the match played out and, maybe excluding a few second serve returns, I felt like I was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.""I'm not the most flexible and at the end of the year I was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where I didn't do anything," said Henman.Henman made an impressive start to the year, only faltering against Nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4."It's a great start to the year - just what I was looking for," Henman told his website.Now I have a day off and hopefully play better the next match.""All in all I'm happy with the match, and I won it - that's a good sign.But the Briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the Argentine."It was about getting used to the surface," he said.

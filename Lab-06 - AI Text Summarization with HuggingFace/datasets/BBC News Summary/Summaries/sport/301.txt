"It was a hell of a tough game," said O'Sullivan."We had our first attack in the Italian half after 22 minutes," said O'Sullivan."The second half was about spending more time in their half.""We struggled in the first half because we hadn't the football."They had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22."Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan heaped praise on Italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in Rome.

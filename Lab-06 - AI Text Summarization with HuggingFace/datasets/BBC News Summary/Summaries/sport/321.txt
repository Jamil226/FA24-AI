Toulouse's former Irish international Trevor Brennan could be one of Clive Woodward's many surprises when the 44-man Lions tour squad is announced."If you speak to the players there's a huge amount of respect for the guy," Woodward told the Sunday Independent."I've spoken to quite a few players, and they probably don't know what they're actually saying when we're having these conversations," he told the newspaper.It's not just the Irish, but Welsh and English players as well."Brennan, who last played for Ireland against Samoa in 2001, is held in high esteem by the former England coach.

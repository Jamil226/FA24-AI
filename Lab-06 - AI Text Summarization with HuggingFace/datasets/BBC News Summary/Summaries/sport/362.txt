The Wales Students rugby side has become a casualty of the Welsh Rugby Union's reorganisation at youth level.The secretary of the Welsh Students Rugby Football Union, Reverend Eldon Phillips, said: "It is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year.The Welsh Students Rugby Football Union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches.But that move has seen the WRU decide to end its funding of representative sides such as Wales Students.

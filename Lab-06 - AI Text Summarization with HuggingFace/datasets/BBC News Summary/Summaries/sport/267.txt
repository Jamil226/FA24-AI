Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club."But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit.""Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club."If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season," he said.But he added: "If Tynecastle could have hosted 30,000 it would have been fantastic but that's one of the benefits of Murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it."It could help."There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play.

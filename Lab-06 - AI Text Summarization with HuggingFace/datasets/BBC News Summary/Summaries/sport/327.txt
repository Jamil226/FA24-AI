France play what Sella believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday 12 March.But Sella added: "People forget that France can still win the Six Nations and they'll be focused on that."The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time," said Sella."This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup," said Sella, "which Laporte is doing very well.Former France centre Philippe Sella believes coach Bernard Laporte must recall Frederic Michalak to give his side any chance of beating Ireland.But while Sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against Wales, he said "the win was most important"."He does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset Ireland."Delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back Michalak.Sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half Yann Delaigue in the RBS Six Nations to date.The 22-year-old Michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after Delaigue impressed for Castres early in the season.

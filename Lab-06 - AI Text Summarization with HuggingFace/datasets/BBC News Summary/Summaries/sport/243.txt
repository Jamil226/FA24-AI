"Steven can win all he wants with us and we need him."But if we want to win more games, important games, we need Steven in the team."The main point I have made is I want to be in a Liverpool side which challenges for the Champions League and the title all the time," he said afterwards.Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry insists the club will never sell Steven Gerrard amid reports Chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from Anfield.Reds manager Rafael Benitez believes Gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs."I want to be winning things with Liverpool, not somewhere else.Gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give Liverpool a 3-1 win over Olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages.He has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future," said Benitez."There is no chance of Stevie going in January," said Parry.I think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team."

Serena Williams has angrily rejected claims that she and sister Venus are a declining force in tennis.While Serena is through to the Australian Open semi-finals, Venus went out in the fourth round, meaning she has not gone further than the last eight in her last five Grand Slam appearances.But Serena added: "Venus had a severe strain in her stomach.I don't know many who have done that.""To top it off, we have a very, very, very, very, very close family" Serena continued.But Serena denied their challenge was fading, saying: "That's not fair - I'm tired of not saying anything.Serena also said people tended to forget the impact the 2003 murder of sister Yetunde Price had had on the family."To be in some situation that we've been placed in in the past little over a year, it's not easy to come out and just perform at your best when you realize there are so many things that are so important.

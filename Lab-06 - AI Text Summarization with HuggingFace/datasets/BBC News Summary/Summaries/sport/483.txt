Ninth seed Nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match, and there was no indication he would do so as Hewitt dominated the first two sets.The balance of power changed completely in the third set as Hewitt allowed his level to dip, and he double-faulted twice as Nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set.But Nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider.It was always tough serving second in the fifth set," said Hewitt, who had never reached the last four at his home Grand Slam.And he had words with Hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the Australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs.Hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 and set up a meeting with Andy Roddick.It's set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals."

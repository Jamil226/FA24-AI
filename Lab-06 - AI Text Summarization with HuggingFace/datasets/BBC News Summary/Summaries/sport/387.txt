But Woodward added: "The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark."But I would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.""Every player has to be looked at on their own merits and Simon Taylor is an outstanding player and I have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip."I think it's absolutely critical and with the history of the Lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries."British and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year's RBS Six Nations Championship.As a result, Woodward stressed his Lions group might not be dominated by players from England and Ireland and held out hope for the struggling Scots."I am told he should be back playing by March and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the Lions - and there are other players like Richard Hill in the same boat.""If you are not playing international rugby then it's still a step up to Test rugby.And following the All Blacks' impressive displays in Europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of France, Woodward believes the three-test series in New Zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.Dallaglio, Back and Johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides.

I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd," Greene said.But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals."In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy.Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg.I lost because of the things I did," said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday.It was my mistake."I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.""That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there.Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer."I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race.

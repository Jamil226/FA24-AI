Robinson said: "We are certainly not on the decline."I have had a word with Mathew," said Robinson.England captain Jason Robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline.But full-back Robinson believes the new-look England team can stop the rot against France.England were beaten 11-9 by Wales in their Six Nations opener in Cardiff last week and face current champions France at Twickenham on Sunday.Robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old Newcastle centre Mathew Tait, who made his international debut against Wales but has been demoted from the squad to face France.We have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day.""But if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then I am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need.

Switzerland, Ireland, France and Israel are all now tied on five points from three matches - although the Republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in Basel and Paris."In Paris, we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances."As I play on the right for my club and being a natural right-back, it was something he (Kerr) looked at because France play strongly down the left-hand side.Manager Brian Kerr was keen to mention the contribution of Stephen Carr and Finnan on Ireland's right flank at the Stade de France."So I was happy to play and Stephen Carr and I enjoyed the game, particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks.""In Basel we did not play great football, but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game.

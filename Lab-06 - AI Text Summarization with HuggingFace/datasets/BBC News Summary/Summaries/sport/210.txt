It is particularly strange as - until last week - Tevez was not even an especially big name in Brazil, where the Argentine Championship is not shown.'The new Maradona' - Carlos Tevez - is joining Corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year.Hounded by the press, Tevez grew tired of his life in Buenos Aires.Some 65 years ago Bernardo Gandulla left Boca Juniors in his native Argentina and headed for Brazil.Like so many of the top South American players, Tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left, to pass when he was expected to dribble, to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares.Corinthians - or the London-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for Tevez.Tevez, then, can kiss tranquillity goodbye.The most turbulent place in this frenetic city is Sport Club Corinthians.So now he says that he is heading for Corinthians in search of 'tranquillity.'But the subsequent months have not been easy for Tevez.Corinthians have not qualified.It is the most passionately supported club in Brazil.Boca re-signed Martin Palermo, forcing Tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role.Another Boca Juniors player is coming to Brazil.

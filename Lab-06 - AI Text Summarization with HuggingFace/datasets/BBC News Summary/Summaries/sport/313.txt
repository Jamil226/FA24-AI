The 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.Tough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England's Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday."I don't know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way," he added."But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester - people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree.The Leicester tight-head is in the form of his life, making the England number three shirt his own.White missed the vast majority of last year's Six Nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going."It gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you."On form, Ireland should be favourites but you just don't know - that's the great thing about this tournament."White is now one of the more experienced members of the England squad which takes to the field on Saturday."It's been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants."When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.He destroyed South Africa's Os du Randt in the scrum at Twickenham last autumn to give England the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory.He has played a bit at tight-head but I think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good," he added.

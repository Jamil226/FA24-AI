Wales hooker Mefin Davies is likely to stay with English side Gloucester despite reported interest from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys.Although he got match time with the Ospreys at the request of the Wales management, he admitted before his move to Gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated."It was a hard time throughout the summer, then deciding whether to accept an offer from Stade Francais which would have ended my Wales career.""The WRU didn't give me any help off the field, it was very disappointing," Davies said at the time.

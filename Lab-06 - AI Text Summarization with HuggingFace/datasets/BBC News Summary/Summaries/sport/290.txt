Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan was surprised that England coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break."I think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while.""What I do know is that England played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us.Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said: "We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter."Andy was sitting two yards from me and I couldn't see whether he was offside or not so I don't know how Andy could have known," said O'Sullivan."As for my try it was a move we had worked on all week.Ireland fly-half Ronan O'Gara hailed his side's 19-13 victory over England as a "special" win.There was a bit of magic from Geordan Murphy and it was a great break from Denis Hickie."Byrne said: "It was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard.All round it was fantastic."

Sydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in June or July, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said on Wednesday."We still need to discuss the options with the IRB (International Rugby Board), the Lions and our SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia Rugby) partners, but June or July is seen as a better option than March to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available," he said.The match will include players from the Lions tour of New Zealand.ARU chief executive Gary Flowers said the world cricket charity match in Melbourne earlier this month had inspired the ARU.

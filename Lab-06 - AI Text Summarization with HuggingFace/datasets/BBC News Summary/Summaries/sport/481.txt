Andy Roddick has ended an 18-month association with coach Brad Gilbert which yielded the US Open title and saw the American become world number one.Roddick won 121 of his 147 matches while working with Gilbert, and said he had enjoyed their time together.Federer, who has not had a coach since he split from Peter Lundgren at the end of last year, beat Roddick to win the Wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals."The decision to not re-hire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time," said Roddick."I have enjoyed all of my time with Andy," Gilbert said on his personal website.Roddick hired Gilbert after deciding to part from coach Tarik Benhabiles in the wake of his first-round exit at the 2003 French Open.

England coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales.The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out.Robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates Sunday's set-to with France at Twickenham.It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way.And the midfield pairing of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon is also under threat.Tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an "unforgiving place" for the teenage prodigy.His Newcastle team-mate Noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major Test.Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour.

A US judge has set a preliminary trial date for the Balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics.The judge said that she may conduct hearings in January into whether federal agents illegally searched the Balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company's founder Victor Conte and its vice-president James Valente.The company has been accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil.And she set a March date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard.The USADA claims that 10 athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for THG and modafinil.US district court judge Susan Ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in San Francisco.

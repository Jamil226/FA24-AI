Aston Villa's Thomas Hitzlsperger is waiting to learn the future of manager David O'Leary before committing himself to a new contract with the club.O'Leary has been in talks over a new deal and he said: "I had a message from Thomas' agent asking me what the news was on myself.But he wants assurances that O'Leary will also be committing himself long-term because negotiations over a new three-and-a-half-year contract appear to have stalled."The reason Thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me."

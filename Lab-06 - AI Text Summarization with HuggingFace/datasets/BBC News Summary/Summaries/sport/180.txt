Victory over Premiership strugglers Southampton, would bring the mighty Manchester United to Griffin Park and a gigantic pay day for the sole League One survivors.- To get to within two matches of a second visit to the Millennium Stadium in three years for the final, Harry Redknapp must guide his side past a club 36 places inferior on the League ladder, and a manager 19 years his junior, who played under him at West Ham.- SOUTHAMPTON go into this tie on the back of an eventful Premiership match with Arsenal on Saturday.Southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago."Brentford have done well but we are the Premiership side and should have the better players.But to write another chapter in their FA Cup history, the Solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since Rotherham, from the second level, beat them 2-1 in a third round tie at Millmoor on 16 January 2002.- Brentford boss Martin Allen: "After conceding eight goals in our last three matches, I have to admit I'm not very confident.But they haven't lost in six League and Cup games on home turf - winning three and drawing three since the reverse to Torquay on Boxing Day."Southampton have just drawn with the Premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already."The retention of their ever present Premier League status must be the number one priority, irrespective of the rewards that success against Brentford would bring.- The Londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent League outings - three each in losing away to Hartlepool and drawing at home to Sheffield Wednesday.Southampton striker Henri Camara scored twice from close range to put the Saints in command, but Isaiah Rankin hit back just before half time, and Sam Sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes.

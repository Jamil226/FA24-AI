Scotland secured their first win of the campaign on Saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over Italy."That's the last thing on our minds at the moment," said Williams, a second- half replacement in Saturday's 24-18 win over France in Paris."Italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it's very hard to win," he said.Rhys Williams says Wales are still not thinking of winning the Grand Slam despite a third Six Nations win."We've come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we'll worry about Ireland hopefully after we've beaten Scotland.""That's my job and we've got to make sure we're focused."With captain Gareth Thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb, Williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far.Matt Williams' side has shown little in attack, but Johnson insisted the Scots will be difficult opposition to break down.

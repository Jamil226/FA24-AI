"We controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time," he said.Hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given England a late win."They won the game from kicking penalties from our 10m line.England went in at half-time with a 17-6 lead but they failed to score in the second half and Dimitri Yachvili slotted over four penalties as France overhauled the deficit.Andy Robinson said he would "keep working on the kicking" with his squad.However, the England coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat."I'm very disappointed with the result and with my myself," Hodgson said.he said.Fly-half Charlie Hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in England's 18-17 defeat to France."We went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have France done?"The lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half, they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn't build on it.

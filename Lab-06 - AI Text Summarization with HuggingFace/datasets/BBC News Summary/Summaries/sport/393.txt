Mike Tindall's agent has warned Bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the England man or risk losing him to a rival club."Mike has been at Bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive," the agent added."But Brownsword has to recognise Mike's value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week."Dipo Alli says he has received an offer for Tindall which dwarfs Bath's deal and that two other clubs want to talk.

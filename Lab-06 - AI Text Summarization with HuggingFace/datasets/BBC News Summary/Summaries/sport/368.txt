And for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between England and France for the Six Nations title.Last Saturday, one newspaper proclaimed that England were still the number one side in the world.Not that England or France, who have won nine of the last 10 Six Nations titles between them, will lay down quietly., who secured a first Triple Crown in 19 years last season, could go one better and win their first Five/Six Nations title since 1985., who start with home games against Ireland and Wales before travelling to Scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the Championship.A fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if England emerge triumphant from an opening Six Nations engagement in Cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach."Clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment," declared Wallabies coach Eddie Jones on arrival back in Sydney."There are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%."While South Africa's over-confidence in Cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, Wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the All Blacks in one of the best Tests in recent memory.After two reasonable performances against Australia, the Scots' humbling by the Springboks forced coach Matt Williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent.Fortunately for the French, the opening match of the Six Nations sees them entertaining  in Paris.Their momentous victory over the Springboks can only bolster Ireland's self-belief, while Ronan O'Gara's late drop goal to deliver victory over Argentina was further proof that Eddie O'Sullivan's side can now close out tight games.

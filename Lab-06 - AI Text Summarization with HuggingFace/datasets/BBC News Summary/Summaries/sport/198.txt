But Edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of United's challenges during the game, particularly on Jose Antonio Reyes.However, Edu tried to play down the incidents, adding: "There was nothing that I haven't seen in Brazilian derbies.The Brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at United boss Sir Alex Ferguson."Reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and Gary Neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off."I like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry."

Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio.Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels.But the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information.However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper."And blogs were a key part of that transformation."Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics.Others, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content.But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events.US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months.Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse," says Mr Nachison.It is in transition, as society itself is in transition," says Mr Nachison.Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog.

A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code.Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus.Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread.Essentially, Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus.Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the Bofra virus and its variants in circulation.Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down.Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to.The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail.The virus that uses this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 November.The Bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug, can infect machines running Windows 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, XP and Server 2003.

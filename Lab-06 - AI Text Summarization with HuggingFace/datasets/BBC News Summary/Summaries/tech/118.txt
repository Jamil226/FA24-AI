By early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.The names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann.In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success.The other proposed names include a domain for pornography, Asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture.Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted.Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service.In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations.The .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body.

The study by US researchers, Pew Internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing."Both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music, rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy," said Ms Madden.Musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found.For part of the study, Pew Internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians, songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between March and April 2004.They ranged from full-time, successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music."Even successful artists don't think the lawsuits will benefit musicians," said report author Mary Madden."Musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically," said Ms Madden.Many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing, the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it."We looked at more of the independent musicians, rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry," Ms Madden told the BBC News website.The survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet, rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood.

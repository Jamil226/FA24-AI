"One of the problems with video phones is people don't really know what to video.There are currently about 1.3 million video phones in use in the UK and three times more single people in Britain than there were 30 years ago, With more people buying video mobiles, 3G dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people.The lure once was that you could hide behind the technology, but now video phones are in on the act to add vision.Hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world's first video mobile dating event.Whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen."With a video meeting, you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don't like them you don't have to suffer the embarrassment."With money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat, the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with 3G, thinks Paolo Pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts IDC.The event, organised by the 3G network, 3, could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events, like speed dating, continues.The impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net, and the growth of 3G technologies.Dating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies.Lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable."One is chatting and the dating element is key there," he said.But the barrier that comes with SMS chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are.Flic Everett, journalist and dating expert for Company magazine and the Daily Express, thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers."The foundation has been set by SMS and companies are using media like MMS and video to grow the market further."So checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier, an extra layer of protection; a case of WLTS before WLTM.

Mr Hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more "business-like".Mr Hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines.Jason Kingsley, chief executive of Rebellion, said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because "the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger".He said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close.Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said that more UK firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles.All companies said they were investing in new tools - called middleware - in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control.He said Climax was already directing about 20% of its resources to preparation for next generation titles."As consoles get more powerful, the content gets more detailed and that means more cost," said Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, which develops games in house and also publishes titles."Once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities," he said.Mr Hasson said: "In the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers."

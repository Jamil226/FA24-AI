Also, said Mr Trainor, research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays - currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop.Intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry.On a larger scale, said Mr Trainor, improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient.Some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space, said Mr Trainor, though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing.The changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made, to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displays.Some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking, said Mr Trainor.It was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs, he explained.Intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they need.He was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs.This work has led to the creation of the Mobile PC Extended Battery Life (EBL) Working Group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power.

A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the UK government.The NISCC spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets.Full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people Between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones.The National Alerting Service for the Netherlands (aka De Waarschuwingsdienst) and the US National Cyber Alerting Service also tell citizens of serious security threats.Those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people.Alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves.The alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms.Warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is, how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble."IT Safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems, mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items, safe," said Roger Cumming, director of the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC).The NISCC, which is running the service, also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software, firewalls, and software updates to stay secure.

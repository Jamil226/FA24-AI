Symbian said that the spread of the Skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself.Symbian phones produced by Sony Ericsson, Motorola, BenQ, Arima and Fujitsu are unaffected by the Skulls program.The Skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias Tee-222.The Skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.The firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again.The file, nicknamed Skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming.The program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone.

Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet "rogue-dialling" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.I was very impressed with our phone company recently.Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for.The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling.These scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them.One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid.The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers."So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach."Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: "Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner.Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.This was because of the scam.Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.It has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge.Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line.Phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said.How about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted?Premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented.A few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.I haven't "fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography.The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future.I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number.To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls.I have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam.Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place.It's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up!That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage.People who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams.

Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc."Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes," said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium.Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly.Respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times."We print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected."A European consortium of companies and university groups known as Respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps.Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.Humanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Respond's maps."Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently," said Mr Voigt.

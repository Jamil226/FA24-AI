This was also true of the average blog reader, although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities.Reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them, the survey found.Just under one in 10 of the US's internet users read political blogs such as the Daily Kos or Instapundit during the US presidential campaign.Some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the US presidential campaign.Despite the explosive growth, more than 60% of online Americans have still never heard of blogs, the survey found.The survey, conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year.The rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information, with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators.

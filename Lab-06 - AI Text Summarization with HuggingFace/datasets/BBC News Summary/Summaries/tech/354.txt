US Customs claimed Mr Griffiths was one of DOD's leaders but his lawyer, Antony Townsden, told the BBC News website it was a laughable suggestion and added: "He was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn't even download software.He said 29% of computer software in Britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost Â£1bn in revenue for software companies, their suppliers and distributors.Mr Boyd said: "It was truly global in scope.A spokesman for the Business Software Alliance said: "DOD members claim they did not profit at all.He said DOD and other warez groups were fostering a "culture of piracy" on the internet.A spokesman for US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement, Dean Boyd, said DOD did not appear to be motivated by money.Mr Boyd said the destruction of DOD was a great coup but he added: "I'm not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem.Mr Townsden said if he had committed any crimes he should be prosecuted in Australia, not the US.But the authorities in both Britain and the United States considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as DOD, one of a number of so-called warez organisations operating on the internet.Their motivation was the kudos which surrounded being able to crack sophisticated software.But Mr Boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost.US Attorney Paul McNulty said at the time: "John Sankus and his techno-gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught."Internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem."Alex Bell, whose trial at the Old Bailey ended on Friday, was known as Mr 2940 - after a computer device - while his co-defendant Steven Dowd's nickname, curiously, was Tim."It cost US industries a lot of money, billions of dollars," he said.Two men who were part of a huge network of internet software pirates, known as Drink Or Die, have been convicted at the Old Bailey.He claimed the Australian government's decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current "acquiescent" attitude to the US.At least 60 people were arrested worldwide - 45 of them in the US.

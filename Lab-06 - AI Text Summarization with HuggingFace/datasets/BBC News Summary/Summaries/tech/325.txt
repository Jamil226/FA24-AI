"The technology has been around on PCs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone," said Mr Monteith.A fishing game is the first title to use the technology, creating a 3D sound field while the gamer plays.Sonaptic has been working with Japanese mobile network NTT DoCoMo to set standards for 3D audio on mobile phones."Your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset."Mr Montieth says: "If the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other - if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear.Firms AM3D and SRS both offer stereo-widening technology for mobile phones.Sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading."We have focused first on Japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market."We knew Japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology.British firm Sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3D audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers.The surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone.The structure of the ear works as a 3D encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating."There are quite a few basic technologies out there, making the sound seem a bit bigger, headphones a bit nicer.

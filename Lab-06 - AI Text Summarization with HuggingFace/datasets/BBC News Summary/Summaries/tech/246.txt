Asimo has already made his mark on the international robot scene and in November was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame.The Japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new, improved Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) can now run, find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people.Car-maker Honda's humanoid robot Asimo has just got faster and smarter.To get the robot running for the first time was not an easy process as it involved Asimo making an accurate leap and absorbing the impact of landing without slipping or spinning.Its makers claim that it is almost four times as fast as Sony's Qrio, which became the first robot to run last year.Asimo has improved in other ways too, increasing his walking speed, from 1.6km/h to 2.5km, growing 10cm to 130cm and putting on 2kg in weight.He is one of a handful of robots used by tech firms to trumpet their technological advances.The criteria for running robots is defined by engineers as having both feet off the ground between strides.

BT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams, which can cost dial-up net users thousands.Inadvertently downloaded by surfers, rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on.Icstis, the UK's premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives.There are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content, sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card BT said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem.The second initiative BT announced is an early warning system which will alert BT customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills.From May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user's "pre-approved list".The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services.It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams.

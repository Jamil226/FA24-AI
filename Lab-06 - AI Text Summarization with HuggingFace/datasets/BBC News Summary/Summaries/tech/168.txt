Dr Nielsen said the success of sites such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important.Dr Nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site's total design, were as important as ever.Some design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said Dr Nielsen."I think it's amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms," said Dr Nielsen."All are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet," he said.Research by Dr Nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines.But, says usability guru Dr Jakob Nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use."A lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off," he said."Roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today," he said."Those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful," said Dr Nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.Dr Nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today.Often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not.

"You will have all of your music on your mobile."Gilles Babinet, chief executive of mobile music firm Musiwave, said: "Music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music."All three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market.But the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs.Mr Babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over PCs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future.Full-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability.Tomorrow you will discover and consume music via one device - the mobile."Mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival Apple's 60GB iPod.You have to switch the PC on, load the operating system, load the program, buy the music, download the music, and then transfer the music.But the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated MP3 players are numbered."One of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while PCs are used for downloading," said Mr Babinet  "We don't want people to cast aside their PCs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems," explained Mr Guest.Mr Babinet said: "Today you use radio and TV to discover music.Musiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and Mr Babinet said the industry was enjoying "definite momentum.""We want music to be a continuum."Can mobile phones replace the MP3 player in your pocket?The seamless experience of mobiles and PC downloads is approaching, he predicted."You must enable people to transfer music from a PC to a handset and vice versa."

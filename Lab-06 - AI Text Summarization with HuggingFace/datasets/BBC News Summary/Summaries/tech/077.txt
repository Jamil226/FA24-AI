As the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves.Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data.He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order."If you think of criminals they do not do clever," said Mr King, "they just do what works."The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs.But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code."It's about outright criminality now," said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about."In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now," he said.With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover.

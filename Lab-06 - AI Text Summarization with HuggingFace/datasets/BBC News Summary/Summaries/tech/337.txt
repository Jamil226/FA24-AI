Both began life as search engines although in 2000, when Yahoo chose Google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business, it was very much Yahoo that commanded press attention.He believes Yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users, something it has rediscovered in recent years."Yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to Google," he said "They thought Google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor," he added.He believes the rivalry between Google and Yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between Yahoo and MSN.Yahoo has reached the grand old age of 10 and, in internet years, that is a long time.Nick Hazel, Yahoo's head of consumer services in the UK, thinks the fact that Yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead.If you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then Yahoo is it," he said."I believe Yahoo is the seminal brand on the web."It is interesting that in these last few years, it has refocused on search following the success of Google," he said.He is convinced Yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web.It is a battle that Yahoo is currently winning, he believes."Microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and a global name but it has yet to show me it can create a rival product to Yahoo," he said.

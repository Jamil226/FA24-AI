Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world.Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web.Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone.It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates.How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.

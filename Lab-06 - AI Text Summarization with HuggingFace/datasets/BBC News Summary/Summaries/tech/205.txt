"The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and 16 times faster than most broadband services," said Mr Stening.An eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider UK Online.UK Online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and TV by 2005 if the service proves popular.It is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband TV.It represents a "big leap forward" for broadband, said Chris Stening, UK Online general manager.The service is possible due to a decision to loosen BT's strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.The service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use BT's exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.Not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas.

Mr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released.The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company.However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released.But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer.In 1982, Mr Raskin left Apple entirely.Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at his home in California.Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer, has died.

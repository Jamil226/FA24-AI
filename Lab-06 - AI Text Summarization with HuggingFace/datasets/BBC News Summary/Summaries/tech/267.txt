Web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank Google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search.Some may see this as the height of laziness, but in an era of information overload, search has become a vital tool in navigating the net.Microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search.Search is not just about finding your way around the web.If Microsoft sees search as important, then nobody queries it," said Mr Holzle.Google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts, which appear at the top and down the right-hand side of a page and are related to the original search."Search was always important," said Urs Holzle, Google vice-president of operations."User experience has contributed to people searching more," said Yonca Brunini of Yahoo."People didn't realise that search was the future.But search is hardly a new phenomenon.In order to do a better job, search engines are trying to get to know you better, doing a better job of remembering, cataloguing and managing all the information you come across.Over the past 12 months, giants of the technology world such as Microsoft and Yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action.And as Google has shown, there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without.The odds are that when you fire up your browser, you go straight to your favourite search engine, rather than type in a web address.For all these advances, search is still a clumsy tool, often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind.

Mr Underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals.Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to Texas.John Underwood, the man behind the Live-Shot website, said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site.Already the Live-Shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session.For a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare Texas ranch.As such there was nothing to stop Mr Underwood letting people hunt "unregulated" imported animals and wild pigs.A Texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs.In a statement the RSPCA said it had "grave concerns" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle.Mike Berger, wildlife director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting.

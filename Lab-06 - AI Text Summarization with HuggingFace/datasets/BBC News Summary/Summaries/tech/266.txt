The original Blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to Microsoft's then new Xbox console.As in the original, your feline persona can control time, but this time the pigs get to control space.This time around you do not play as Blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters.There are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps, space bubbles and void traps in order to progress.The thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing Time Crystal.As the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters.The control over space and time is achieved through a number of VCR-style icons and is quite intuitive.

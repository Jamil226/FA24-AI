EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry.Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children.Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities.Video game giant Electronic Arts (EA) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world.Jan Bolz, EA's vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture.He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims."People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them."Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s.He also said EA was planning an international awards show "similar to the Oscars and the Grammys" which would combine video games, music and movies.He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (Â£16bn) - but it remained a goal for the company."You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it," he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.

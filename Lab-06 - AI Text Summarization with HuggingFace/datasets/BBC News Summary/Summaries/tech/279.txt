ScanSoft and Gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control.Music and film fans will be able to control their digital media players just by speaking to them, under plans in development by two US firms."Pairing our voice technologies with Gracenote's vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they've never imagined."The firms gave no indication about whether the iPod, or any other media player, were in mind for the use of the voice control technology.Portable players are becoming popular in cars and a number of auto firms are working with Apple to device interfaces to control the firm's iPod music player.They want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car, or at home or on the move.Users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion, or a film just by saying the actor's name.

Security firm Network Box said that it stopped more than 30,000 copies an hour of the virus as the outbreak reached a peak.The Windows virus grabs e-mail addresses from Microsoft Outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims.The new variant is called Bagle.AT, Bagle.BB and Bagle.AU and the attachment bearing the virus code is labelled as either "joke" or "price".As well as plundering Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses to send itself to, Bagle.AT also tries to turn off the firewall and security centre services on Windows XP machines.The virus can strike computers running Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP.BBC News Online has received five warnings about the virus from security companies.

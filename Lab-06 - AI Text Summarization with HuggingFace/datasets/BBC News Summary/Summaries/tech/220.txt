"Transfer of data between different memory types has improved significantly in recent times, and will be further helped by the standards for hard drives which are currently being developed by the major manufacturers," said Mr Larsson.The cost of making hard drives has dropped and is continuing to do so because of improved technologies so they are proving to be more cost-effective than other forms of memory, he added."Floppies and memory keys have their place, but they don't have anything like the capacity or flexibility of a hard drive so are unable to meet the demand for more and more storage capacity in consumer devices," said Mr Larsson.Gadget lovers are so hungry for digital data many are carrying the equivalent of 10 trucks full of paper in "weight".They suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006."Britain has become a nation of information hoarders with a ferocious appetite for data," said Martin Larsson, general manager of Toshiba's European storage device division.According to technology analysts IDC, a fifth of all hard drives produced will be used in consumer electronics by 2007.The survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built-in hard drives like music and media players from Apple, Creative Labs, Archos, iRiver and others.The amount of data that can be stored has grown by 400% in the last three years, while the cost for every gigabyte has fallen by 80%.

Called Speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results.A Scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.The Edinburgh-based firm CEC has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search.Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine Google.Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said Mr Renton.But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November."We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is looking at the technology," he added.According to search engine Ask Jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net.But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web.

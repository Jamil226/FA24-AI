Nintendo's DS handheld game console has officially gone on sale in Europe.About 130 games for the DS are in development.Games for the DS are expected to cost between £19 and £29.A "download play" option means DS owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game.The DS spearheads Nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market.Part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the DS can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for Nintendo's GameBoy Advance handheld.Five Virgin megastores and 150 Game shops were expected to open early on Friday morning to let people buy a DS.As well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the DS also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless.

The site is thought to have closed following an announcement by the Motion Picture Association of America that it was launching legal action against those operating BitTorrent servers rather than end users.The site was the most popular place for people swapping and sharing links for the BitTorrent network.In the opening days of the MPAA campaign, the organisation filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server site.Phoenix Torrents, another popular BitTorrent site, has also decided to shut down and, though it gave no reasons for the closure, it is thought to be motivated by the threat of legal action.Because of the way that BitTorrent works, server sites do not host the actual file being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have it.In a message posted on Suprnova.org on Sunday, the site's controllers said the site was "closing down for good in the way that we all know it".

The Cell processor, which will drive Sony's PlayStation 3, will run 10-times faster than current PC chips, its designers have said.IBM has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year.The chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 GHz, the firms said.While the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use Cell, the chip's designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones.If Cell is to challenge Intel's range of chips in the marketplace, it will need to find itself inside PCs, which predominantly run using Windows.Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on Monday.It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip.By comparison, rival chip maker Intel's fastest processor runs at 3.8 GHz.IBM said Cell was "OS neutral" and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if Microsoft's Windows was among those tested with the chip.

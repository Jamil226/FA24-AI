But, he said, the Mac mini changed that perception."The Mac mini is not quite ready for that yet," he said.The release of the Mac mini fit perfectly with this trend, he said.Apple has traditionally done well in the market that the Mac mini is aimed at, said Mr Fogg, who also expected many PC makers to release copycat devices in reaction.The Mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer, he said."Apple has been hoping that sales of the iPod will have a halo effect on the sales of the Mac," he said.Apple's work on making things easy to use would also help the Mac mini win fans, he said.Said Mr Fogg: "It's very much a computer.""They'd be much more likely to pair a Mac mini with a LCD or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost," he said.He said anyone wanting to use the Mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor.The Mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said Mr Fogg.Mac watchers and some analysts say the Mac mini will go a long way to help Apple appeal to the mass of consumers.Before now, he said, Apple has been seen as a premium brand."It's a particularly good price when you see that it's Apple that is doing it," he said.The Mac mini has been welcomed by Apple fans, industry experts and PC users.Apple expects the Mac mini to sell for Â£339 in the UK and $499 in the US.Although the Mac mini was very cheap for an Apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many PCs."It's deeply affordable," he said.

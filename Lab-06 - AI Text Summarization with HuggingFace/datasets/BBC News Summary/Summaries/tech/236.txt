Online pages from scanned books will not have adverts but will have links to online store Amazon, Google said.The New York library is allowing Google to include a small portion of books no longer covered by copyright.The full libraries of Michigan and Stanford universities, as well as archives at Harvard, Oxford and the New York Public Library are included."We hope that Oxford's contribution to this project will be of scholarly use, as well as general interest, to people around the world," said Reg Carr, director of Oxford University Library Services.Harvard is limiting its participation to 40,000 books, while Oxford wants Google to scan books originally published in the 19th Century and held in the Bodleian Library.There will also be links to public libraries so that the books can be borrowed."It's a significant opportunity to bring our material to the rest of the world," said Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library.About one million books will be scanned by Google, less than 15% of the total collection held in the Bodleian.

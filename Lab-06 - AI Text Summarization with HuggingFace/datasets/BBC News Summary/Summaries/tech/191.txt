Online communities set up by the UK government could encourage public debate and build trust, says the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR).But he adds, government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too.In its report, Is Online Community A Policy Tool?, the IPPR also asks if ID cards could help create safer online communities.With 53% of UK households now with access to the net, the government, suggests Mr Davies, could act as an intermediary or "middleman" to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more "cosmopolitan politics" and public trust in policy."Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online.They could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online.Although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online "commons" for public debate.Proposals for ID cards, for instance, could also be widened to see if they could be used online.There is a role for public bodies like the BBC, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of "cliques" talking to each other, he added.The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members.

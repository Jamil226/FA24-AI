Recent Bond games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair, invention and glamour of the film franchise.This title lacks that aura, and when the Bond magic shines through, it feels like a lucky accident.The notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game, but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.What the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy, dynamic scenes of violent chaos.Rogue Agent signals its intentions by featuring James Bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter.It is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker's allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up.The game is weak, not completely unplayable.Adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game, for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original's massive sense of fun.GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is out nowBy far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like Dr No, Goldfinger, hat-fiend Oddjob and crazed Russian sex beast Xenia Onatopp resurrected after all these years, and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion.Diehard fans of Bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings.For gaming fans, the word GoldenEye evokes excited memories not only of the James Bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left N64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.

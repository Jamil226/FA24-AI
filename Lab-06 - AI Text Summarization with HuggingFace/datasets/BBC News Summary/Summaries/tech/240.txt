After years of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the US and Japan.By contrast, HDTV offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels.There is already a HDTV service in Europe called Euro1080.British TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels.Many high-end European TV programmes, such as the recent Athens Olympics, are already being produced in high-definition.In the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006.But TV viewers in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images."The BBC will start broadcasting in HDTV when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming," says Andy Quested, from the BBC's high-definition support group.But to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a HDTV set to receive them.According to Mr Quested, this could help put Europe back into the running in the race to switch to HDTV.Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan has spurred European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change.For now, broadcasters like the BBC are working on their own HDTV plans, although with no launch date in sight.All television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down.

The Texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e-mail marketing.The attorney general alleges that messages sent by Mr Pitylak and Mr Trotter's companies broke the 2003 Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (Can-Spam) as well as the Texas Electronic Mail and Solicitation Act and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act."Leadplex and PayPerAction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal Can-Spam Act," said Lin Hughes, speaking on behalf of Mr Pitylak and Mr Trotter.Mr Abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines, not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in Texas.US state Texas has filed a lawsuit against two men believed to be among the world's top five spammers.Lawyers for the alleged spammers said the lawsuit was groundless and the two men would defend themselves strongly against the accusations."Illegal spam must be stopped," said Greg Abbott, Texas attorney general announcing the legal action.In a similar move the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has won a court order that stops an international group of spammers sending sexually explicit e-mail.

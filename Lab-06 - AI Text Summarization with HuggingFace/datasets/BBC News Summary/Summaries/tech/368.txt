"What we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source," said Mr Pollard."We have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic," said Rob Pollard, sales director for Arbor Networks which is behind the fingerprinting system.The creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack.Mr Pollard said Arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected.Once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem.Firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source.Eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically.Increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites, launch worms and relay spam around the net.

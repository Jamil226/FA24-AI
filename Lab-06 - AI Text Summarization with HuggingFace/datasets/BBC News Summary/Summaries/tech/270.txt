So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave.Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King."It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site," she said.Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time.Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up.Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said.Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days."We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together," said Mr Seagrave.Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems."The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail," said Ms Capella."We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack," said Ms Capella."You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another," said Mr Seagrave.This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from.

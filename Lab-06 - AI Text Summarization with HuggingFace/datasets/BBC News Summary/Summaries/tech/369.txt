Microsoft is planning to make Windows and Internet Explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information.Microsoft is developing a new version of Internet Explorer browser and its operating system, Windows, which has been code-named Longhorn.The system would differ from its previous attempts to make online transactions more secure, said Microsoft.Although the flaw was fixed, Microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in Internet Explorer."Info cards" will help people manage personal details on their PCs to make online services safer, said Microsoft.Michael Stephenson, director in Microsoft's Windows Server division, would not confirm however whether the new info cards ID system will be built into the current Windows XP version or Longhorn.While Passport and Hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net, the latest system will store data on a user's PC.Last year, it released a major security update for Windows, Service Pack 2, to combat some of the security concerns.

The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October.Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.In second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California.IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops.The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002.

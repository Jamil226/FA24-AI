Because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them.We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward.Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law.When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall.This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the "Next Generation Secure Computing Base", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware.What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform.Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features.At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems.Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys.And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today.Hardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer.But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them.Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, "Longhorn".This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it.Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management.One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away.

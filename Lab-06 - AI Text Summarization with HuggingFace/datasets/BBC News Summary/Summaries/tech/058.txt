Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said Mr Ingram.British Telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers."These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections," he said.He said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40Mbps.Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month.Customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced."Britain is now broadband Britain," said Duncan Ingram, BT's managing director, broadband and internet services.But Britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially Japan and South Korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40Mbps.

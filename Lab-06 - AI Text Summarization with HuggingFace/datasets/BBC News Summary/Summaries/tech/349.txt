With a broadband net subscription, you can also get your TV and phone service.The BBC recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it, said Rahul Chakkara, controller of BBCi's 24/7 interactive TV services.The corporation's Interactive Media Player (iMP) is its first foray into broadband TV - known as IPTV (Internet Protocol TV).It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (HD) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional, regular broadcasts.According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales, 30% of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV.Broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes.BT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband.Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value, says the BBC, because it gives people more control, and more choice.It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders (PVRs), gives people much more control over TV.It helps, said Mr Burke, that people are more au fait with terms like "digital", "interactive", now that digital TV reaches more than 56% of UK homes.But IPTV could be used for home-monitoring, "pet cams", localised news services, and local authority TV, too says BT.Analysts say that IPTV will account for 10% of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade.BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services, rather as an "enabler", said Mr Burke.They could get IPTV though.Since it uses internet technology, IPTV could mean more choice of programmes, more, more interactivity, tailored programming, and more localised content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts.Both use broadband net connections to carry information, like video and voice, in packets of data instead of conventional means.

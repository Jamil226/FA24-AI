Indeed, it seems like there has been a CM game for as many years as there have been PCs.Eidos announced the next CM game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers Sega, under the name Football Manager.But given that Football Manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up?SI kept the game's code and database, and Eidos retained rights to the CM brand, and the look and feel of the game.A game like FM2005 could blind you with statistics.But that does not do justice to the game really.With so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area.Well, Football Manager is the spiritual successor to the CM series, and it has been released earlier than expected.What we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the Earth.If you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take Margate into the Premiership, Spurs into Europe, or even putting Rangers back on the top of the tree, FM2005 could be the best purchase you ever made.If you were a fan of the previous CM games, then FM2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it.At this point CM5 looks like it will ship early next year.In fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience.For the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of Championship Manager (CM).Football Manager 2005 out now for the PC and the MacHowever, last year was the final time that developers Sports Interactive (SI) and publishers Eidos would work together.

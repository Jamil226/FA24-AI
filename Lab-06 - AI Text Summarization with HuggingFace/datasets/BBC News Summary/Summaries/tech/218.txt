Still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's Sands Of Time, the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.Warrior Within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.The only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry Empress Of Time before she ever creates the Sands of Time that caused the great beast's creation.Those flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect.That in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path.There is something strangely unsatisfying about the game.It just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.Ever since the series' then-groundbreaking beginnings on the Commodore Amiga, Prince of Persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts.It is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of Onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax.That said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game.

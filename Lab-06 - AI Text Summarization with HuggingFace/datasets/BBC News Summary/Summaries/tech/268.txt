For each of the past 12 years IBM has been granted more US patents than any other company.The company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called a "patent commons".Mr Jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration.IBM was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the US, the New York Times reports.IBM has received 25,772 US patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40,000 current patents.Computer giant IBM says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community.IBM will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents.In a statement, Dr John E. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property, said: "True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted.IBM described the step as a "new era" in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available.Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial.Traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite IBM's announcement the company continues to follow this route.The patents include software for a range of practices, including text recognition and database management.In the past, IBM has supported the non-commercial operating system Linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine Microsoft.

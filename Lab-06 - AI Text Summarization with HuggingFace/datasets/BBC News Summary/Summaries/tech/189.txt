Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites  Internet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail.Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with.As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann.Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann.Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver.By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity."We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do," said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe.Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days.He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web.To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods.

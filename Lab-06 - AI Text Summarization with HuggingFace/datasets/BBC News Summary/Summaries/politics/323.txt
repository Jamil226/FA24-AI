Mr Cook, who is giving evidence to the Power inquiry into voter turnout rates, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme it was not fair to blame the public who were "more interested in politics than ever before".The government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.Ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of "pager politics" and not being heard.He also criticised the cult of personality politics: "There's far too much interest in celebrities.Voters' "pent up passion" could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election, Charles Kennedy has said."They are turned off by the way we do politics in Britain.

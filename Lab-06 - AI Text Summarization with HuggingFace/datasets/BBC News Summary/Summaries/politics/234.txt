Mr Blunkett said he wanted "to go back to a time when I was very young, when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work".The best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed.Mr Blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police.Police forces were already "buried" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them," said Mr Davis.Earlier Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.He has also started to recruit 25,000 Community Support Officers (CSOs) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects.The home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police.Local people would also be able to "trigger" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done.The plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted.Opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork.

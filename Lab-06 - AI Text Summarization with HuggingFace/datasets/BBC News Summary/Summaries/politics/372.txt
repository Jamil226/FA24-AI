The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002.ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could "dramatically reduce the chances of fraud"."It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system," he said.A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout.Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll.The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce.But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as "gimmicks" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said.The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.

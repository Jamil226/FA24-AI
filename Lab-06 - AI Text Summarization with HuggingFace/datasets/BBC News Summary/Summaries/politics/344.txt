It is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts.Ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the Tory party are urging Mr Howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election.And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax."At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less," he said.Michael Howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned Tory tax cuts.Of that, £23 billion would go on spending plans, with £8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by Gordon Brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.Should he win the next general election, he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how.The extension of that, however, was that Labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the Tories were the cutters.So far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third New Labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances.

During a question and answer session with first-time voters on Five News, Mr Blair said he had no option but to "confront it" by talking to people.In answer to a question from 22-year-old Liverpool student David Dunne about concerns over the prime minister's personal integrity, Mr Blair said talking was the only answer.He was not "forcing" anyone to go to university, but places should be there for those who wanted them, he said.He insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying: "Sometimes people say because of what has happened in Iraq this is the next place."By talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them, even if they did not agree with them, he said.

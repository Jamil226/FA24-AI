About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet."And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.""We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible.Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced."But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges."Ms Hodge said: "Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society."Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity."

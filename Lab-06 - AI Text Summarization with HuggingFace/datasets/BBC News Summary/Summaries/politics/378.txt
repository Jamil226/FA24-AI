Mr Blair told the BBC the "control orders" would only be used in the most limited circumstances.BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords, where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties.On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders.She said the legislation was "a travesty and a perversion of justice" and would remain "unpalatable" even if a judge was involved early in the process.Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue.But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in "rushing" anti-terrorism legislation.But the government is continuing to insist that "control orders" must be issued by the home secretary.Barbara Follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in South Africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders.

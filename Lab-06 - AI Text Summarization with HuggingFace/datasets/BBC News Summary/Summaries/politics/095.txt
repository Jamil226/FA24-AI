But the chancellor said Mr Baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge.He also said that as Mr Baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge.Number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a "soap opera" about Mr Blair and Mr Brown.Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of "competing agendas" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair.What the chancellor wanted was "not by any means what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see", Mr Baume said.Mr Brown said: "To be honest I don't think you can rely on his [Mr Baume's] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making."Mr Blair and I are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms.

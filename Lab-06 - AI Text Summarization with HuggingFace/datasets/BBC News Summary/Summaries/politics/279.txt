Ms Khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system."The human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights," she said."By using the language of war, human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war."Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message."Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups," she said.The lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups, Amnesty International's chief has said."What's a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war," she said.The Amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism.

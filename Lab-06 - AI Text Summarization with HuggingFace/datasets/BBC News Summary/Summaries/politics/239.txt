The Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as "eyes and ears" for the police.She said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street.But the government said the move would help police "build safe communities"."The powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling," she said.Ms Blears said the study shows CSOs are "making a real difference" in the fight against crime.She denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets.Shadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures.The federation said CSOs do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with "potentially confrontational" situations.

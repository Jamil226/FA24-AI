Ahead of Sunday's meeting in London, Ms Hewitt said she was proud of the UK's "vibrant games industry" but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults.Violent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing, the trade and industry secretary has said.Patricia Hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of 18-rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on Sunday."Video games are different to films or videos, and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do.Violent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February.She is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include "high levels of violence"."So you shouldn't let them play an 18-rated game.Roger Bennett, head of gaming industry body ELSPA, said banning violent games would be wrong.Anyone convicted of selling an 18-rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to Â£5,000.Ms Hewitt said: "Adults should be treated as adults and children as children.

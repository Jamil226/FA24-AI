At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.He said Mr Blunkett's integrity remained intact: "He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up.Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan's findings.He said: "Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa.On Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinn's nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average.Earlier, Mr Howard said: "There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry.But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance.Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was "a strong case for a judge-led judicial review".The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny.

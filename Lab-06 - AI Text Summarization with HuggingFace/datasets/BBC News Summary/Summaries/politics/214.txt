"Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives."There was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, MPs said.The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate "amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group".The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered.Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: "Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.The committee also highlighted "deeply worrying" cases of children and young people taking their own lives.Many of those who ended up taking their own lives had "presented themselves" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said.The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems.

Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be "intolerant of intolerance"."I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society," said Mr Bell.He highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 Muslim, 100 Evangelical Christian and 50 Jewish schools.Mr Bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were "tricky issues".Mr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a "common heritage" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion.Independent faith schools were singled out by Ofsted chief, David Bell, for not doing enough to promote the "wider tenets of British society".

The law lords' ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary last Thursday following David Blunkett's resignation.New Home Secretary Charles Clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to Parliament early in the new year with proposals.House of Lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week.Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions "in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons.Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: "Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law."The home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.In a statement on the same day, Mr Clarke said: "I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.But the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week.They said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for British suspects.

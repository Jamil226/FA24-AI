At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list, the first minister has told MSPs.He said he was proud of the generous response of people in Scotland to the disaster appeal, which is expected soon to top Â£20m.But he said Scotland was "in it for the long term" with help planned for fishing communities, for children's services, and for the aid charities.Mr McConnell went on to promise that Scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort.Mr McConnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the Make Poverty History campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities, trade unions and churches in the run-up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July.He said 2005 must be the year that Scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world, whether in Asia or in Africa.

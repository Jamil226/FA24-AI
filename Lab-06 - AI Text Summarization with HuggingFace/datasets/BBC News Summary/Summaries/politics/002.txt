All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was "too unlikely to have been a coincidence", Mr Beith said.Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the "e-mail regime" could "support the freedom of information regime".Richard Thomas "totally condemned" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January.Mr Thomas said: "The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence."Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said.But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records".He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor.

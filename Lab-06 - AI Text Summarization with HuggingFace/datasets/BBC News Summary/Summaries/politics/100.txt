He said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002.Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp.Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: "I've lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim.In a statement, it said: "The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war.Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam.Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead.And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga's transfer to Guantanamo.He said: "The pattern is the same.Mr Mubanga said the "MI6 agent" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission.And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot.

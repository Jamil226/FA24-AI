Executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should "be beyond reasonable doubt".An executive spokesman said: "We will study this judgement in detail.The Scottish Executive has lost an appeal against an inmate's compensation for being forced to slop out in prison.Much has changed to address the issues raised in the Napier case, for example, slopping out has ended at Barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated.Napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights.On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought Â£5,000.The executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates.Scottish National Party Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill said that the slopping out case had been "a fiasco from start to finish".

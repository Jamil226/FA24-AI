She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid.The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as "desperate", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children.Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: "While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected."We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra Â£1,400."Ms Hewitt said: "We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks.Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children.

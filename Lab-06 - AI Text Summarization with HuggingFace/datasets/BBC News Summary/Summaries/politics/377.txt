A spokesman for the British Casino Association, which represents the UK industry, said the government was trying to allay fears over a "UK Las Vegas"."The UK industry is one of the world's most respected," he said."The UK gambling industry is being totally frozen in time, and the foreign companies will take over."He said the way the licences were being awarded meant UK firms were at a massive disadvantage and foreign companies would be certain to win the contracts.Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said proposed super-casinos will be different from their US counterparts.Controversial new UK casinos will be banned from using American tricks of the trade to ensure they are "socially responsible", it has been suggested.Eight super-casinos are proposed from 2010 if the Gambling Bill becomes law.

Michael Howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.Mr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research.Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types.But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems."Mr Howard acknowledged there were "no easy answers" over such an issue but it was necessary to "have the courage to do what we know to be morally right".He added: "Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery."I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research."I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses," he said.The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed.

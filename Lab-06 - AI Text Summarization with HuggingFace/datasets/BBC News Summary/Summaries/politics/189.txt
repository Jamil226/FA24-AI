Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was "fractured, divided and uncertain", Mr Blair said.Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an "umbilical cord" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.Mr Bush's first task was to "rebuild a sense of domestic purpose" within the US, he said.Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added.But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change.Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most "pressing political challenge" of the present day, Mr Blair warned.Tony Blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term as president.Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions.

A Conservative spokesperson said: "The Liberal Democrats can talk all they like about strategy.Mr Howard's seat is at the top of the Liberal Democrats' list.He said it was "nothing personal" but that "very many of the prominent Conservatives" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second.In 2001, Michael Howard won the Folkestone & Hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907.The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies.The Liberal Democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top Tories - including leader Michael Howard - at the next general election.

Within hours of his final talks with Mr Thorpe, Sir Edward told the nation he was resigning and the Queen invited Mr Wilson to form a new minority government."The PM said he was bound to tell Mr Thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister.Mr Thorpe told Sir Edward: "I am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for you.Documents show that Sir Edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a Labour-led coalition.But Sir Edward said that was impossible because the Labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a Conservative-Liberal pact."Jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally," reads a telephone memo for Mr Heath.Hours later Sir Edward's hopes of a deal unravelled as Mr Thorpe's colleagues refused to support him.But he already knew Mr Wilson would not form a coalition with either the Liberals or the Conservatives because of the opposition of the Labour left.According to the documents released at the National Archives, the "friendly and easy" first meeting indicated that both Sir Edward and Mr Thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal.Mr Thorpe was in high spirits, having just led his party to a historic jump in support.Mr Thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime minister's colleagues."

"Limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling," he said.Tessa Jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the UK to 24, in a move branded a "humiliating retreat" by the Tories.Shares in British casino operators London Clubs International, Rank Group and Stanley Leisure, who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos, fell by between 10 and 25% following the announcement.But Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a "shambles".Instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small, medium and large.The Culture Secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.It puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos, originally outlined in the government's Gambling Bill.

And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over."If we don't like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people," he said.He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK.Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain.Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.Mr Davis said once Britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the UK open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant."The Liberal Democrats have long argued that Britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it's right that we don't do this in isolation.""By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto."David Blunkett has been accused of using the "politics of confusion" to disguise new EU immigration measures.He accused the government of being "pathetic" when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of "surrendering" on the issue.

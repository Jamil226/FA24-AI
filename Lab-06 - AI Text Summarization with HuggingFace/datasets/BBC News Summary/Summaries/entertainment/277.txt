The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s.The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.Sensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical.The original stage production of The Sound of Music is to be performed for the first time in the Austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released.The song was actually an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein.

"The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show," said Max Houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University, US.Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: "There's more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research."People have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the CSI TV shows, real experts say.Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the show's influence in dealing with the families of victims.Evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim.Dr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions.Each episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal.Lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used."Defence attorneys also worry about the CSI effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that's always accurate."

The head of Christian Brothers' school St Fintian's, Richard Fogarty, said the video implied that the 24-year-old pop star had attended his school and was abused there.McFadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the song's lyrics, saying it had "cell blocks".They have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental.The new video of former Westlife singer Brian McFadden has been pulled after a Dublin school complained about being associated with his song Irish Son.Corporal punishment was outlawed in Irish schools in 1982 when McFadden was two years old.St Fintian's High School says it is clearly identified in the video, while McFadden never went there.

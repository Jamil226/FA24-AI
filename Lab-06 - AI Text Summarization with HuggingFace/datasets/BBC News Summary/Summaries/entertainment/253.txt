Angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years.Whilst Angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in Robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.Best song of the last 25 years?Best song in the last 25 years?I think Angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but I don't think its the best song from the past 25 years!Robbie Williams' Angels was named the best song of the past 25 years.It's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???Best song in 25 years?Although Angels is a good song I think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.A great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years?That's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years.Angels is without doubt a great song but I really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on Robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!!The best song of the past 25 years?I've nothing against Robbie, I actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year?If this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble.The initial list was very weak anyway, but Angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!!But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years!I'm actually embarrassed to be British if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!Booo hisss  Angels, best song?I very much doubt that 'Angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out.What a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - I don't think so!!While I am biassed in that I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart should have won, in all seriousness, I think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.Best song in 25 years, you must be joking.Only the best song to be up for nomination at the Brits.Why a half-baked cheesy ditty like Angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on Pop Idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.I am a regular listener to Radio 2 but I don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly NOT the best song of the last 25 years.There is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.Ok I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song.I think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isn't really that good a song.Angels is a fantastic song.Yes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning."Angels" isn't a bad song.Personally I find Angels by Robbie Williams to be one of the most irritating songs I have ever heard!Best of the last 25 years?I am a huge Robbie fan and love that song.Think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than Angels.There must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more.I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.There must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids.Williams' track beat songs by Will Young, Queen, Kate Bush and Joy Division in a vote by BBC Radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the UK music industry ceremony.But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.A sad day for music  It's not the type of music I normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, I recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.Angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.The success of Angels at this years Brits reflects poorly on the state of British music over the last 25 years.It is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.McFly won the best pop act prize, and Gwen Stefani picked up the best international female artist award.I find it hard to believe that 'Angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years!The flamboyant act scored a hat-trick in the international categories, winning the best group, best album and best newcomer awards.What about all the REAL artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but Robbie Williams doesn't even come close.It should have been Joy Division.Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song.it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.Little Britain comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams presented the best song prize to Robbie Williams dressed as his former Take That colleagues Gary Barlow and Howard Donald, leading him to quip he was "always the talented man of the band".Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.The song is overplayed and oversentimental.Granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition.Right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was Will Young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good!There were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win!Much better songs and more timeless.Phil Collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote?Also, why weren't the Stones there, David Bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than Angels...I wonder if it was simply the fact that Robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!The US band, who opened the show with Take Your Mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.Franz Ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best British group, an award they dedicated to late DJ John Peel.It's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song.Keane won best British album and breakthrough act.If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.Natasha Bedingfield - in the running for best British female and best pop act - performed with her brother Daniel for the first time at Wednesday's event.A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.Soppy rubbish at best.It just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick Robbie Williams over the beautifully talented Kate Bush and Joy Division.That song has become such a bane to me that I have developed a Pavlovian response to the word 'Angels' where I thrash around, and scream "no no no no no" until someone tells me "the radio's off".It seems obvious to me that people who like Robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much.The song makes me calm and serene and happy.The Queen's song was lackluster, and apart from Kate Bush, the other choices were pathetic!Will Young won the best single prize for Your Game.Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels.If you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote.I think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people.Viewers of digital music TV channel MTV Base voted Stone the winner in the best urban act category.I'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'.There's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling.Sure Robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.It's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.They weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.Robbie was a deserved winner.Why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?Just like Robbie.After beating Amy Winehouse, Jamelia, Natasha Bedingfield and PJ Harvey to the best British female prize, Joss Stone said: "I don't know what to say.Glasgow group Franz Ferdinand won two prizes, as did Keane and Joss Stone, who was voted best urban act by digital TV viewers.Best British male artist winner Mike Skinner - aka The Streets - does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the Birmingham hip-hop artist performed his hit Dry Your Eyes at the ceremony.Whenever the song comes on the radio I turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out).Then again, well done Robbie, good show.But they missed out on best British live act, which went to Muse.Whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...We forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example.

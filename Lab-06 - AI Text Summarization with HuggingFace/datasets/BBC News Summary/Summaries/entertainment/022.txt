A spokeswoman for the RAD said: "It is our responsibility to re-ignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the long-term future of ballet.The RAD have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in British ballet.New research from the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) has found fewer children over the age of 10 are attending ballet classes and taking exams in the discipline.Fewer children in the UK are following in the dainty footsteps of dancers like Darcey Bussell, and carving out potential careers as ballet dancers.The RAD found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11.But a spokesman for the English National Ballet told BBC News that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were British, around a quarter of the company's dancers were from the UK."It's not a very cool thing to do when you go to 'big' school and I think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it," she said.Ms Trew, who runs a dance school in Gateshead, admitted it would be "very difficult" to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed.Currently, only two out of 16 principal dancers at the Royal Ballet - Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope - are British, compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985.Aimed at children aged 10 to 13, it is hoped the contest will help keep British ballet evolving."What better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance?"And there are fears that if the trend is not reversed, there could be fewer British ballet stars in the future.

"I was very happy that (DiCaprio) came and cared to come up and find out what (Hughes) was really like," she said.The star was presented with the award by Martin Scorsese, who directed him in Oscar-nominated movie The Aviator.Veteran actress Jane Russell, who starred in Hughes' 1943 film The Outlaw, said was impressed by DiCaprio's quest for authenticity when he previously discussed the role with her.The achievement award was created to commemorate the California festival's 20th anniversary and coincided with DiCaprio's portrayal of millionaire Howard Hughes in The Aviator.A retrospective of his movies was shown."It's a lifetime achievement award, which is completely and utterly surreal, given I'm only 30 years old," DiCaprio said.

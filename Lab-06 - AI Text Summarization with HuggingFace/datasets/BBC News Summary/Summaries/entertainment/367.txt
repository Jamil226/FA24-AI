And Mr Goodridge said best film and director were between Martin Scorsese's Aviator and Million Dollar Baby."As Chris Rock accurately said, they're about celebrity and fashion," Mr Strauss said."Film-makers haven't produced films that people adore this year," he said."I hope this is the year for small films to triumph," he said.Mr Karger, whose favourite film of the year was Mike Leigh's abortion drama Vera Drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments."Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby affected people emotionally, which is why it will beat Aviator, which was about technical artistry not feelings," Mr Karger said.Mr Strauss doubted whether Rock would make an impact, but added: "I'm all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the Oscars."The near constant flow of US film awards, representing directors, actors and producers' guilds, also means "few surprises" are left by the time the Oscar ceremony is upon us, he said.The film world and media may be wild about the Oscars but cinema-goers and the TV-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies, according to some LA film critics.Mr Karger said the comic might boost younger viewers, but Mike Goodridge thought Rock's humour could prompt America's conservative states to switch off."2004's films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in America that things might not be so rosy after all.Screen International's US editor Mike Goodridge thinks 2004's films have simply not grabbed the public's imagination.

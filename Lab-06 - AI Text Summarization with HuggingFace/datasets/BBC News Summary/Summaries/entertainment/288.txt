Rapper 50 Cent has ended his public feud with his protege The Game as the pair said they wanted to be good role models for their communities.The Boys Choir of Harlem got a cheque for $150,000 (£77,800) from 50 Cent, while The Game handed over $103,500 (£53,400).The row blew up when 50 Cent threw The Game out of his G-Unit crew and accused him of being disloyal."We're here today to show that people can rise above the most difficult circumstances and together we can put negativity behind us," 50 Cent said.50 Cent is no stranger to feuds, with rapper Ja Rule among the targets for ridicule in his songs.Chart-topper 50 Cent, real name Curtis Jackson, said the truce came on the anniversary of the death of the Notorious BIG in 1997, who was part of a volatile feud between the east and west coast rap scenes.50 Cent announced he has launched the G-Unity Foundation "to help people overcome obstacles and make a chance for the better in their lives".

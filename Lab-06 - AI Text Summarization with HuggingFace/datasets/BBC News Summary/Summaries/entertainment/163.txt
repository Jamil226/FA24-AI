Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs.The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957.The six unedited reel-to-reel tapes - which were owned by the engineer who recorded them - are valued at up to $50,000 (Â£29,000)."He called them his ass-saver tapes," his son said."We've had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them," Nogar's son Stephen, 57, said.

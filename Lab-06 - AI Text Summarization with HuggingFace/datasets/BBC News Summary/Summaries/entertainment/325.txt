Film actress Annette Bening is up for an Oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film Being Julia.Bening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance.Bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe.Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes.But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact.The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening's role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999's American Beauty.

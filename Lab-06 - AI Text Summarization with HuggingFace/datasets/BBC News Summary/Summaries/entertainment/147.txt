Mr Newton and the Beastie Boys were not available for comment.Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed.US rappers Beastie Boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song Pass the Mic."We hold that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton's copyright," Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion.A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton's recording.

The government shouldn't "fund" music - it should "invest" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.Yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies!Areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music?The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US.If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy.Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers.As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move.Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities  I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer.Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff.We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music.Call it a tax on music "pollution", if you like."But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well."Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they're a musician.Kapranos said there was a general "hostility" towards classical music, adding: "There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM."If they can fund football, why not fund music?The government has enough problems funding schools and health services.If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal.I think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state?Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotland's role in making 21st Century music.Rather than expecting the government - i.e.Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting.

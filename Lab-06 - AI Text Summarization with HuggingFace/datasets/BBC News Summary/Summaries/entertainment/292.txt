Preview performances of the Â£3m musical Billy Elliot have been delayed to give the child actors a less arduous rehearsal schedule.Director Stephen Daldry made the decision to re-schedule the previews to protect the young stars."The decision has been made to push back our preview performances in order to give our company, with a cast including 45 children, a little extra time so they are as fully prepared as possible."He added: "The young Billy Elliots in particular, making their professional stage debuts in the West End, will benefit from a little extra time to familiarise themselves with all aspects of the production."Child labour laws also mean the young actors can only work for a limited period each week.Adult actors in the show include Tim Healy as Billy's father and Haydn Gwnne as his dance teacher Mrs Wilkinson.Daldry directed the successful film version of Billy Elliot, adapted from Lee Hall's script.

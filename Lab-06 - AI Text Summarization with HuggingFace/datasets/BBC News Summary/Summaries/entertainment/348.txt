Festival director Dieter Kosslick says this strong showing signals "a new consciousness for European films".Some 350 films will be screened at this year's festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it."It's just that there are more good European films."Organisers say this year's Berlin Film Festival, which opens on Thursday with period epic Man to Man, will celebrate a revitalised European cinema.But Mr Kosslick says more would be coming had the Academy Awards not been brought forward to 27 February."This isn't to say there aren't any good American films," he continued.

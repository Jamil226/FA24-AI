One puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90.I have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.Would have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn't come up to scratch.It's all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation.Part of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.I believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it's original, witty, and modern.The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.There are plany of modern children's book that would make excellent films or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin.Personally i'd like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K.It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe's car.Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie???The only one that isn't to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I'd like to see.The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.I'm only 27 and don't remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it's a classic.The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung!Personally, I think it shows that no one has any originality any more!Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on.Thats the appeal though, it's so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.The new big-screen version of The Magic Roundabout, released in the UK on Friday, is the latest attempt to turn children's television into box-office gold.Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it's just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in!Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved.I'd like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role.This re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people's ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$.Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.Perhaps if the remakes were done in a 'Look Around You' mock-authentic style I might be interested ...  Chorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega!I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.How about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate.Dan Jolin, reviews editor of Empire magazine, says classic children's TV shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children't movie that really let it down.But then again, it couldn't be better than the original series, could it?My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!!I'd luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same.TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ's are sampling or re-working 70's and 80's music.I'd hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magic.All I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids' show ever.Love to see Transformers with real actors and CGI.Just imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse  Bob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks.There WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back.And the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors' outrage that Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins.Despite Thunderbirds' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.I think remakes are a good idea.The Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February.Make a movie version of the Banana splits!Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.With screen versions of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake's Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business.If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great.The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate's wonderful voices.:-)  Noggin the Nog was one of the best children's programs.It's always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!)But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs.It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas?

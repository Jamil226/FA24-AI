A novel set in 19th century Paraguay has won the $10,000 (Â£5,390) fiction prize at the US National Book Awards.Children's author Judy Blume, who was given an honourary medal, used the ceremony to speak out over censorship.The National Book Awards non-fiction prize was awarded to Kevin Boyle's for Arc of Justice, which focuses on a black family's fight to live in a white Detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s.This year's fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as Philip Roth's The Plot Against America and instead chose five little-known books, all by New York-based women.Her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness.Sales of Blume's books have exceeded 75 million, but her work - which features frank narratives about families, religion and sexuality - is closely watched by the censors.The winner in the poetry category was Jean Valentine for Door in the Mountain: New and Collected Poems, 1965-2003.But his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone.

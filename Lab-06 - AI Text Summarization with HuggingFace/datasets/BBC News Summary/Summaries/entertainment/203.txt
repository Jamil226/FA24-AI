Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's "bullying" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.VOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking "agendas".The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved "like a child rather than a parent" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink.Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.She said "superior" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying.DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1.Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still "wide open", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1.

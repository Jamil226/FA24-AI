Nigel McCune from the Musicians' Union said British musicians are "disadvantaged" compared to their US counterparts.A US Embassy spokesman said: "We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily."The Musicians' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face "an uphill struggle" to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical.Musicians' groups are to tackle US visa regulations which are blamed for hindering British acts' chances of succeeding across the Atlantic."The US is the world's biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy," says Mr McCune."The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US," he added.A singer hoping to perform in the US can expect to pay $1,300 (Â£680) simply for obtaining a visa.

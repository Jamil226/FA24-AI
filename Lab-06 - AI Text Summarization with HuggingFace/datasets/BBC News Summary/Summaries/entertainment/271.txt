Tim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive.Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem."I don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful."The music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (Â£1.8bn).The German music business - the third largest in the world - is "in the state of a zombie" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said."The problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out," he stated.However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation was as "dramatic" as Mr Renner believed."So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.""We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying."At that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the Napster time, when P2P services became popular.

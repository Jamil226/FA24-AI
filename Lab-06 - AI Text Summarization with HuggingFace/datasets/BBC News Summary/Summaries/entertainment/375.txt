Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson.Ms Kite began to work for Mr Jackson in February 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the US and Europe.Ms Kite said she received a phone call on 13 February 2003 from a Jackson associate, Marc Schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the Neverland ranch where they had been staying.The Smoking Gun website publication was "beyond disaster", Ms Kite said.Ms Kite told the court she had later asked Jackson's lawyer, David LeGrand, what had happened.Ms Kite suggested Jackson's associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser's family after the airing of Martin Bashir's film Living with Michael Jackson.A PR expert has told the Michael Jackson child abuse trial that the TV documentary at the heart of the case was an "absolute disaster".Questioned by the prosecution, Ms Kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius.In the prosecution's opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him.

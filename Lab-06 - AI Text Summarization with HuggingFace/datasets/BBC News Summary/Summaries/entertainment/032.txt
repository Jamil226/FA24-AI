Redford wanted Sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers, but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream."People started to say we had gone mainstream and Hollywood, but actually Hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film," he adds.But Redford knows this and started the Sundance TV Channel in an effort to reach a wider audience.While Redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent, the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic.With them the celebrities came, then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone," explains Redford.But Redford is not worried."Once independent film had a place where the work could be seen, suddenly the merchants came.Smaller festivals like Slamdance and XDance, which take place during the same week in Park City, are competing for Sundance's limelight."The point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them."Sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say 'it's just a film by so-and so'.""It's the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration," he says.Redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the American media fails to reflect, particularly how the US is perceived internationally.

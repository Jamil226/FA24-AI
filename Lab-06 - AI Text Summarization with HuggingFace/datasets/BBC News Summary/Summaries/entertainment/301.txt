The Sundance Film Festival, the movie industry's top destination for uncovering the next independent hits and new talent, opens on Thursday.But stars like Keanu Reeves and Pierce Brosnan also have films showing there.Other films generating interest before this year's festival include Hustle & Flow, about an aspiring rapper, The Squid and the Whale, an autobiographical film by writer-director Noah Baumbach, and comedy/drama Pretty Persuasion.But it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years.Keanu Reeves appears in coming-of-age tale Thumbsucker while Kevin Costner and Michael Keaton are among the other big names whose films are involved."As much as the press argues that Sundance has completely changed, it hasn't changed that much," festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said.

Director Oliver Stone's historical epic Alexander has failed in its bid to conquer the box office, entering the US film charts at number six.Last week Oliver Stone's film met with scathing reviews from US critics.Top of the box office for a second week was action movie National Treasure.In Sweden last Thursday, to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the Stockholm International Film Festival, Stone expressed the hope that Alexander might be better appreciated in Europe.The swords and sandals blockbuster, rumoured to have cost more than $150m (£79m) to make, earned just $13.5 (£7m) over three days at the US box office.But novelist Gore Vidal defended the film, saying it was "barrier-breaking" for its frank depiction of bisexuality.

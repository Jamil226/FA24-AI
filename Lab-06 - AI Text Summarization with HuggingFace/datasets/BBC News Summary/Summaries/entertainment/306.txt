Organisers of the third Bangkok International Film Festival have been determined to carry on with this year's event despite the ravages of the Asian tsunami disaster."I have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top Asian film festival in the world."Now in its third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar."We've had some bumps in the road, but that's only because the festival is still a baby.Apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned."When the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel," said the festival's executive director, Craig Prater."We have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation's recovery from this terrible disaster," she said.Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the festival's Golden Kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after December's catastrophe."Our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund," he continued.That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.Mr Prater's sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the festival's sister event, the Bangkok Film Market.The festival itself runs until 24 January."I questioned whether I should come when such a tragedy had happened," the British actor said.But the festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme.

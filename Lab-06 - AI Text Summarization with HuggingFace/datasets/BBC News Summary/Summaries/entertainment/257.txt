Janie Hendrix, the guitarist's stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him.The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002.Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre."The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix's house," said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation.Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time.Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist.Now Mr Goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to Seattle's central district, where Hendrix grew up.Seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.

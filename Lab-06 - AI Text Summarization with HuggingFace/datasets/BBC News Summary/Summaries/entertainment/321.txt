The growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US.But global sales of recorded music were flat in 2004, with growing sales in DVD music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets.The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market.However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (Â£17.7 billion).Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK.Around 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases."A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans' demand for great music," said BPI chairman Peter Jameson.The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold.

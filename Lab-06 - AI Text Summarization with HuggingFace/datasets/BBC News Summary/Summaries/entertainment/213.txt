The media in the southern African country, twice the size of France, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives.Many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines.Many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90% of Angolan families have lost someone.However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few.One woman, Victoria Lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in Independence Square live on Meeting Point.Hundreds of thousands of people died in Angola's 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing.Meeting Point has become one of TV Angola's most watched programmes, and has reunited hundreds of families."The programme of family reunification is extremely important, but for these families to remain reunified, there has to be social integration, job access, education, healthcare," said Rafael Marques of the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa.Every Friday, hundreds of people gather in Luanda's Independence Square to record a message in front of the TV cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it.Meanwhile, there remain massive challenges to Angolan families even once they are reunited."Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going."This means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

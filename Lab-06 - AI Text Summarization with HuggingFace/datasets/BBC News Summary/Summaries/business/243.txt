In order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential.I would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn.The layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space.Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space.Prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability.Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style.You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area.A wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient.As for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights.Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others?The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour.This week, we're hearing from Marianne Petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in Sweden into a base for her freelance writing work.It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.Over the next few months, our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work, and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient, more congenial or simply prettier.In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate.Ideally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn.Please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn.

The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities.Officials in Cojedes state said on Friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the Vestey Group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers.Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme.Last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000.The firm, whose Agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in Venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with Venezuelan law.Under President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy.The authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had "nothing to fear".The Vestey Group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.

Thousands of slaves were accepted as collateral for loans by two banks that later became part of JP Morgan Chase.Citizens Bank and Canal Bank are the two lenders that were identified.The bank said that it is a "very different company than the Citizens and Canal Banks of the 1800s"."We apologise to the African-American community, particularly those who are descendants of slaves, and to the rest of the American public for the role that Citizens Bank and Canal Bank played."The admission is part of an apology sent to JP Morgan staff after the bank researched its links to slavery in order to meet legislation in Chicago.

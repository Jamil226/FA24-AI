That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth."Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing," the Kok report said.Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception.But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige.But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality.The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 2010."The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change," said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group.On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy.But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago.But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far.The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth.Lisbon risks becoming a "synonym for missed objectives and failed promises", his report said.Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report."The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit."As Mr Kok's report noted: "The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded."The circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000.The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next.For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn't become a global economic laggard.

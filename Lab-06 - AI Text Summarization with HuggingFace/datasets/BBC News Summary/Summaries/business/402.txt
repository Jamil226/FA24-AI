With the economic picture now looking more rosy, the Fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in June, August, September and November.The Fed has said that it will move in a "measured" way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted by sluggish US and global growth.Although the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three months to September, analysts warn that Fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery's sails."If economic growth should subside... the Fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in its tightening."But if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise a little more quickly, I think the Fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well.""I think the Fed feels it has a fair amount of flexibility," said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae.

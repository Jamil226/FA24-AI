A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (Â£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid.Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn.However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April.A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company.A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an ""unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom.

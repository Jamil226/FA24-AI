The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a "limited" list of companies is being drawn up."We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state," Mr Yushchenko told an investors' conference in Kiev.An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit.But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said.A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted.But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms."That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules," he told BBC News.Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed.The list "will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion", he said.The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (Â£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups.A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Mr Hensel.

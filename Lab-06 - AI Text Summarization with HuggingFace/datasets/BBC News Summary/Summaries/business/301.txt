Libya has withdrawn $1bn in assets from the US, assets which had previously been frozen for almost 20 years, the Libyan central bank has said.The US ban on trade and economic activity with Tripoli - imposed by then president Ronald Regan in 1986 after a series of what the US deemed terrorist acts, including the 1988 Lockerbie air crash - was suspended in April.The original size of Libya's funds was $400m, the central bank told Reuters."We are in the process of opening accounts in banks in the United States," the central bank's vice president Farhat Omar Ben Gadaravice said.

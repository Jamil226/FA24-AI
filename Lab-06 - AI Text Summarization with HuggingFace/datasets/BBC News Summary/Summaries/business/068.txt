He said, "No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone."India has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.The government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments.Mr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired.Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.Analysts say improving India's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too.Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market.

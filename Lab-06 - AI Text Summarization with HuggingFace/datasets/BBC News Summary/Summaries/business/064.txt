German airline Lufthansa may sue federal agencies for damages after the arrival of US president George W Bush disrupted flights.Central to the problem was that instead of half an hour, the arrival of President Bush on the German leg of his European tour took the best part of an hour, Lufthansa said.Despite the problems, Mr Lamberty said that it was not certain that Lufthansa would take legal action.Mr Lamberty said that 92 outgoing flights and 86 income flights were delayed by an average of an hour following President Bush's arrival, affecting almost 17,000 passengers.Lufthansa said that it may lose millions of euros as a result of Air Force One landing at Frankfurt airport.Mr Lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue Germany's air traffic controllers' organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the German federal agencies that gave the orders.

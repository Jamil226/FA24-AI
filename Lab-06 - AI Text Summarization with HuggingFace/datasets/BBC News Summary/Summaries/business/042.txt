UK Coal said it was making "significant progress" in shaking up the business.The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said.The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006.Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule.The company said these actions should "significantly uplift earnings".UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.

Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange's management until May, Reuters says.But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May's annual general meeting.However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: "TCI's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25."The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange's management.Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid.The Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group's chairman and chief executive.

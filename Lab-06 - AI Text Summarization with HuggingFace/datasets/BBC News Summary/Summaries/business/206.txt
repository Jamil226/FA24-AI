Standard Life, Europe's largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004.Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002.Annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%.Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders.Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.John Gill, managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only "partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002".

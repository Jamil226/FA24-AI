"The retail sales figures are very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night, you don't really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter," said Mr Shaw.The last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%.A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December.Retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.Clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth, according to the ONS.UK retail sales fell in December, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 1981.Yet, other retailers - including HMV, Monsoon, Jessops, Body Shop and Tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year.

Southcorp said Foster's takeover offer was "opportunistic".The two companies held four days of talks after Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January.Foster's said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an "unrivalled" collection of premium wine brands.Southcorp said Foster's A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a "excellent strategic fit" but undervalued the company."Southcorp's board has informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company," said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn."The combination of Foster's and Southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance Australia's competitive position on the global stage," said Trevor O'Hoy, Foster's chief executive officer.

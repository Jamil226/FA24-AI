House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December.Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier.New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said.At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of England figures have shown.The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market.He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said.The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004.There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004.

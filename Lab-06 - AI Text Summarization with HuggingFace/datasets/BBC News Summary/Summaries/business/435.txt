Australian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover.Fosters bought 18.8% of Southcorp, the global winemaker behind the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, for 4.17 Australian dollars per share.Fosters bought the 18.8% stake from Reline Investments, the family investment firm for the Oatleys, who founded the Rosemount Estates label and sold it to Southcorp in 2001.Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month.Fosters has done a back-flip", said Shawn Burns, a fund manger at Deutsche Asset Management.Fosters said it was currently in discussions "which may lead to a major corporate announcement".Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival.The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future.Fosters' main wine business is Beringer Blass Wine Estate.Southcorp's shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target.

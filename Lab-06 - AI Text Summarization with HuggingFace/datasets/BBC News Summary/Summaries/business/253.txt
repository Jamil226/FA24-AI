The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office.Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions.The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years."The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover.

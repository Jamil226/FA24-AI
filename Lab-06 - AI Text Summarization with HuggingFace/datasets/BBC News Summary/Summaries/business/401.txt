According to a statement from Mr Spitzer's office, the Marsh executive admitted he instructed insurance companies to submit non-competitive bids for insurance business between 2002 and 2004.Through the practice, Marsh was allowed to determine which insurers won business from clients, and so control the insurance market, Mr Spitzer's office added.It also protected incumbent insurers when their business was up for renewal and helped Marsh to maximise its fees, a statement said.Mr Spitzer's office added Mr Stearns had also agreed to testify in future cases during the industry inquiry."We are saddened by the development," Marsh said in a statement.An executive at US insurance firm Marsh & McLennan has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with an ongoing fraud and bid-rigging probe.

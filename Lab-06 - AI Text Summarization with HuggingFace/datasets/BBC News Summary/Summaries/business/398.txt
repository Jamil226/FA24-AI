Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says.A full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come.According to Mr Mendis, half the IMF support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately.This estimate is preliminary, bank governor Sunil Mendis told reporters, and could rise in 2006.The bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; £27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property.One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country.

But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police.The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable.The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year."An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation," the authors say.According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.And the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western.The paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000.

In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment.But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China.Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home.If Germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be."In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%," he says.Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here.It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in Europe these days.As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.They don't see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes," he says."Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem.That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille.The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world.With Germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem.Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in China and India.New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.In Britain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in recent years.

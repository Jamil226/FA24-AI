A US bank has said it will donate more than $8m to victims of former Chilean military ruler Augusto Pinochet's regime under a Madrid court settlement.The bank had been accused of illegally concealing Gen Pinochet's assets.Last month in a US court, Riggs Bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by Gen Pinochet and the government of Equatorial Guinea.The bank agreed to create a fund for the victims, but the charges were dropped.The general's opponents rejoiced at the settlement, which was agreed in a court in the Spanish capital, Madrid.Riggs Bank will put money in a special fund to be managed by a Madrid-based charity, the Salvador Allende Foundation, which helps abused victims.

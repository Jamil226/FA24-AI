Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia.A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday."I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this," Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters."I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel," he added.The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low.

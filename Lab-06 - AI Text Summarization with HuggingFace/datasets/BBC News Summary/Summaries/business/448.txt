US prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping Dutch retailer Ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (Â£428m).The nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to Ahold, are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores.The suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, providing auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its earnings.Ahold is the world's fourth-largest supermarket chain.Ahold hit the headlines in February 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its US subsidiary Foodservice.It was less severe than many had envisaged, however, and since then Ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence.At the time of the scandal, Ahold was seen by many as Europe's Enron.Pasquale D'Amuro of the FBI called the nine vendors the key ingredients in "the process of cooking the books" at Ahold.

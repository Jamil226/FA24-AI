After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m.It also said the government might narrowly miss its "golden rule" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06.In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget.The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn "black hole" in the nation's coffers.The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total.But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his "golden rule" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle.

Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer, which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny.But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid.The club has previously rejected Mr Glazer's approaches out of hand.But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a "well funded" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.Mr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times.Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%.A spokesman for the Shareholders United said: "I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than Â£200m less debt.His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice.NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times.

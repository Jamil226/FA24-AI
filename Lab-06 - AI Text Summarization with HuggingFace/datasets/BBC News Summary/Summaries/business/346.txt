The impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said.Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said.Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros (£70m; $136m).Swiss Re has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (£5.17bn).Many of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert.Allianz, a leading German insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be.It's more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure," said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co.Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters.Insured damage could be a fraction of the "billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands and Malaysia," said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb."US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure.Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch.However, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a "significant" impact on its business.Most US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds.

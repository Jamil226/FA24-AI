The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said.The sale has destroyed Yukos, once the owner of Yuganskneftegas, said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase."It is a front for somebody but not necessarily for Gazprom," said Oleg Maximov, an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow."We don't know if this company is linked 100% to Gazprom."Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s.Russia's newspapers claimed that Baikal was a front for gas monopoly Gazprom, which had been expected to win.Gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a US court injunction barred it from taking part.It has been hit with more than $27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20% of Russia's oil output is inevitable.

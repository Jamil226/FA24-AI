Russian oil firm Yukos lied to a US court in an attempt to stop the Russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard.Yukos argued that since it had a US subsidiary and local bank accounts, the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk.But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless.Its lawyer, Hugh Ray, told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary.Yukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point.Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos.Yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia.It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz, as the Yukos unit is formally known.By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts.

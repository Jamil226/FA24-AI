Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer.Earlier this month, Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club."Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal," the club said in its statement.In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer "limited due diligence" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid.Mr Glazer's offer values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn).Manchester United's board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books.At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester United's second biggest shareholders."The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive," the statement said, "and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging."Rival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday.But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal.

While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia, the US said the meeting was "much more efficient than we've seen for some time".Mr Johannesson also said progress "on the bilateral market access side is accelerating".His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry.But he said for Russia to make progress the government must "renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law".Talks on Russia's proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been "making good progress" say those behind the negotiations.Some WTO members also dislike Russia's energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage.

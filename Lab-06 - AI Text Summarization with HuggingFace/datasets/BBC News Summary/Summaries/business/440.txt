Although China's overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US's deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before.Against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923.But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years.The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record.One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes.By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement.But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.The trade deficit is a large part of the latter.

The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was "in America's interest".US officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words.But analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary.Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe's economies by eating into their exports.At 0619 GMT on Tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in Tokyo.Meeting in Brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports.European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro.The European ministers' comments, said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo, were "generally too weak to produce a market reaction".

Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said.The ADB fears that 1 million Indonesians could join them, while in India just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty.Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami.But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage," the ADB report said.A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty.Thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while India has also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on its own resources.In its first overview of the disaster, the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage."Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster," said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali.Sri Lanka's government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn.Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs.The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries.

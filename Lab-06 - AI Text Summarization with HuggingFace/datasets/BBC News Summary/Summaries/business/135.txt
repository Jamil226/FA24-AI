The Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave "protected designation of origin" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years.But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece.The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name.The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine.

Mr Brown said it was "winning support every day" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the G8 summit in July.G7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.Mr Brown said G7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005.Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - "the vast bulk" of money owed by the poorest countries.UK chancellor Gordon Brown said the London meeting of the world's seven richest nations would be remembered as "the 100% debt relief summit"."We could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of," he said.But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown's International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries.G7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said "excess volatility" would impede economic growth.But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its "legislative process".But UK plans for an International Finance Facility (IFF) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed.He said much of the money pledged by the US had not yet been dispensed.BBC correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the UK's ambitions, but much work was needed.BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice."The US is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that," he said.

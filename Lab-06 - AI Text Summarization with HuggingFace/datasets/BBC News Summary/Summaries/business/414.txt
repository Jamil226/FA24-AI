Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed a $168m (£89m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm."The settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible," William Lerach, the lawyer leading the class action suit against Enron, said.Under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing.However, the latest deal does not include former Enron chief executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.Leading plaintiff, the University of California, announced the news, adding that 10 of the former directors will pay $13m from their own pockets.The deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of Enron's shareholders almost three years ago.So far, including the latest deal, just under $500m (£378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.

Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent.Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.The tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation.Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit."Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman.The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week.The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of "laddish culture" at the bank."We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender," Merrill said in a statement.

Exxon, the world's largest oil company, has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin 3 field.International oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to Russia's decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005."We regret the ministry has taken such a decision," said Ivan Kulakov, deputy chairman of Highland Gold - a mining firm that has the motto "Bringing Russia's Gold to Market".Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block.What has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism Russia has been courting foreign investment."It would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate."US oil giant Exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement.BP spent $7.5bn to create Russian-registered oil company TNK-BP, and has a partnership to develop the Sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned Rosneft.Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include France's Total, the US-based ChevronTexaco, and miner Barrick Gold.According to Mr Waller, Exxon "were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway".

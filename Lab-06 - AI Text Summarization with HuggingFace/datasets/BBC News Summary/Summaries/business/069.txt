Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes.Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years."Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago" with its product range, said Flight International's Mr Learmount.US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances.It is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008."Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful," said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International.Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry.

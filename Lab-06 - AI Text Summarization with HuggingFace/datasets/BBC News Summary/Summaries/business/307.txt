Cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract.Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year.It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable.The company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas."Cairn refutes the government's position," Mr Gammell said.The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; Â£10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil.But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a "significant downgrade of the initial expectation".Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year.A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.

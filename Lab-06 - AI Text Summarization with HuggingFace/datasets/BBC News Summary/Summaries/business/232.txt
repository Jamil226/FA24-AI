The FSA took over regulation of the general insurance sector in January, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients.In a speech on Monday, Mr Prettejohn urged the FSA to force brokers to disclose the size of their commissions.Brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the FSA said.The head of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, has criticised Britain's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority (FSA).All of the insurance business written in the Lloyd's market is placed via brokers."The FSA should change, and change now" said Mr Prettejohn, who wants it to move from "disclosure on request" to mandatory disclosure.

In the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said.But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month.Stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said.Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said.The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers.

Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems.However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs.The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation.Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago.But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures.

The UK pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.The think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission's initial report into UK retirement savings.The report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the UK pension crisis.According to the Pensions Commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement.

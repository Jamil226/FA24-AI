Japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005.Japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.The Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.Gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004.The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year."The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage," said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka.The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters.

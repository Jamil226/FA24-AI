Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved "challenging" last year.But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector "continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market".B&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market.Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth.Overall, B&B said that "housing market fundamentals remain strong".The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to Â£450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.

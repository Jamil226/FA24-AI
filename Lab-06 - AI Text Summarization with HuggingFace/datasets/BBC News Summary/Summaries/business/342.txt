Japan's Honda has won a copyright case in Beijing, further evidence that China is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property rights.Earlier this week China said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail.Last month the EU said it will start monitoring China, Ukraine and Russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods.Between 1998 and 2002, the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the EU's external borders increased by more than 800%, it said.Despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem, foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small.The problem of piracy is not limited to China, however, and the potential for profit is huge.Other firms that have taken legal action in China, with varying degrees of success, include Yamaha, General Motors and Toyota.

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.The mill, Krivorizhstal, was sold in June 2004 for $800m (Â£424m) - well below other offers.The controversial sell-off of a Ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal, a court has ruled.Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises.Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold.

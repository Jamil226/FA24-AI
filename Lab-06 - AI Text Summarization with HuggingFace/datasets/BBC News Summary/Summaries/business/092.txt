Conservatives in parliament say Turkcell's stake in Irancell, the new network, should be cut from 70% to 49%.Turkcell signed a contract for the new network in September.Iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network, with long waiting lists for new subscribers.They say that Turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with Israel.Turkcell said the ruling would "make more difficult... Turkcell's financial consolidation of Irancell" because its stake would be reduced to less than 50%.The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there.Turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether.Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September.

Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit.Second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged.The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week.Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising.And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo.But disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.And indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster.Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities.A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off.Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched.And the US stock market was on its way down long before 11 September, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks.For a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines.

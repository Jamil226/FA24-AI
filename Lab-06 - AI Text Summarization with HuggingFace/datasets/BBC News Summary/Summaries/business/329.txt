House prices fell further in November and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors found.The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December.A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years.Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate."The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one," RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said.In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more "moderate", RICS added.

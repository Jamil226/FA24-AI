And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit.And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments.The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional "strong dollar" policy."It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point," he said.For the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan.G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe.At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency.Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns.US exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap.

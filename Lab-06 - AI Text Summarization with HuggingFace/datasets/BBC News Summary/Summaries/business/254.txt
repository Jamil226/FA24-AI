According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is "kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies".Video games are "big business", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying.News Corp, the media company controlled by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market.France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm.And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.The success of products such as Sony's Playstation, Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Game Cube have boosted demand for video games."We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts (EA), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies," he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona.

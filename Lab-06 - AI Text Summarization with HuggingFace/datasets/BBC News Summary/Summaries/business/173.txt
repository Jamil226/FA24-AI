Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the world's largest brewers, have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat.Heineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year.Dutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide.Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs.Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in "aggressive" and "high-impact" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005.Carlsberg, the world's fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros).Nevertheless, total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland.

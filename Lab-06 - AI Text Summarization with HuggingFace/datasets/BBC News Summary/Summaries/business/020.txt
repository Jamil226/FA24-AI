The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers.In what Dimension Data calls an "alarming development", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving "agents not equipped to deal with customers".And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?There are "no big differences in wait time and call resolution" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world.Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.Suggestions that "outsourcing" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks.What are your experiences with call centres?However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year.The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents.As a result, call centres have a high "churn rate", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff.

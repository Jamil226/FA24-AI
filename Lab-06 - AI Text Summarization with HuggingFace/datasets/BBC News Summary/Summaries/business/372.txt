Madagascar has completed the replacement of its Malagasy franc with a new currency, the ariary.The ariary was the name of a pre-colonial currency in the Indian Ocean island state.The phasing out of the franc, begun in July 2003, was intended to distance the country from its past under French colonial rule and address the problem of the large amount of counterfeit francs in circulation.From Monday, all prices and contracts will have to be quoted in the ariary, which was trading at 1,893 to the US dollar.

A total of 24.2 trillion pesos ($10.2bn; Â£5.5bn) is earmarked for subsidies for the poor, the government department for planning said.Sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes.Half of the money put aside by the Colombian government to help the country's poor is benefiting people who do not need it, a study has found."Resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution," deputy planning director Jose Leibovich said.

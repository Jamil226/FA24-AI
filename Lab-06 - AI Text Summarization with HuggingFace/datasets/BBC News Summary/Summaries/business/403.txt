"None of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the WorldCom fraud," said the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).Ten former directors at WorldCom have agreed to pay $54m (Â£28.85m), including $18m from their own pockets, to settle a class action lawsuit, reports say.Corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement, it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses, when the firms they oversee face problems."Directors very rarely pay," said Charles Elson, chairman of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Two other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, said the newspaper.It has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay.But, a spokesman for the prosecutor, New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, said no formal agreement had been made.

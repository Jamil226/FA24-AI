The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity.China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant."Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next," said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year.Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River.The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China.The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments.Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted.The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad.

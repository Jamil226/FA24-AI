Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a "put option" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009.Fiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement."We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat," said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; Â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off.Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days.But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share.

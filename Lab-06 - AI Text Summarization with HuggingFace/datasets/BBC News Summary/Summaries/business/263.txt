Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA).Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added.In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to Â£350m in compensation.Further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year."This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome," Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News.

Wales captain Gareth Thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the Six Nations with a broken thumb."It was a great game and a magnificent result for Wales," Bennett told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.But Welsh legend Phil Bennett insisted Wales can cope without Thomas as they chase a first Grand Slam in 27 years.Wales travel to Edinburgh to take on Scotland in a fortnight and then host Ireland in Cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the Grand Slam and championship decider."He did a great job in the second half in France.Bennett, an inspirational fly-half for Llanelli and Wales in the 1970s, insisted the national team were entering a new golden period."Had they been ruthless, Wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down."With Gareth missing I would think Michael Owen will be our captain," said Wales coach Mike Ruddock.But the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding."

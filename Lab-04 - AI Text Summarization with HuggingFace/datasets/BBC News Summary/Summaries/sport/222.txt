"I think we have taken to Europe really well," said McClaren."I think we played quite well and it was a very good game, especially in the first half."And after they did just that he said: "It was a perfect European night.Before the match, McClaren had said that a win over the Italian giants would put Boro firmly on the European footballing map."It should have been more convincing," said McClaren."We didn't expect it to be that one-sided," said Zenden.Middlesbrough forward Boudewijn Zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals."We can also score goals, and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had, so we have good balance."There have been many good performances but this was something special.

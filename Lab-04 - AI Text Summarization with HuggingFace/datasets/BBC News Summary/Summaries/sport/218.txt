Mourinho doesn't simply talk a good game - he's won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto.Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players.I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season, even when Arsenal were flying at the start, and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind.On a more serious note, it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of Sol Campbell to Arsenal.If anything, what I have seen has confirmed my early impressions.Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season.In the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics, and yet he was winning games.He was starting to look the part before he was sidelined, but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title.Campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit.Much criticism has been aimed at Pascal Cygan, but I believe the problem lies with the absence of Campbell and its overall effect on Arsenal's defence.Arsenal need to reverse the process, with or without Campbell, and get some clean sheets on the board.Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League.He is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that way, but he has the silverware to back up the talk.As I said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in Mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now.Mourinho had his say on that game, complaining: "Five-four is a hockey score, not a football score."So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful."I also thought the criticism was very harsh, because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful.

Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.I would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so.It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured.The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil.Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half.It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter, who is a canny manager.John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary.One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith.The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts.The only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce.

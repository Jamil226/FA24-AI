"You know, everybody hits the ball well and there's a very fine line between number one and number 100," said Connors.There was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25,000 people.I say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court.These are the questions Jimmy Connors will be asking of Britain's brightest tennis hopes in the months, and possibly years, to come.In the year that has seen Andrew Murray emerge as Britain's great new hope, Connors rejected suggestions that the Scot might be put under too much pressure too soon."Tim Henman has a whole country on his shoulder," said Connors."I've had discussions with the USTA (United States Tennis Association) over a number of years," he said."Britain has a different attitude, the right attitude, in taking the game forward and finding the next Wimbledon champion," said Connors."It was the most important thing in the world for me, and to do that something's got to be not right with you."The impression I came away with after just seeing David and the other coaches for three days was one like I've never seen before, especially over here."That's something you don't find every day."I was also nuts.Despite the emphasis on hard work, training and preparation, Connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within."I was that fine line for a long time.If I was Andrew Murray, I'd embrace that.

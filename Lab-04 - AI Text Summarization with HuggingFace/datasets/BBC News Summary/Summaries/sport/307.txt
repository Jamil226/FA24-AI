Wales coach Mike Ruddock says England lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel."The referee's interpretation was that Grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck.""If the ball is at the back of the ruck and I feel I can step over and disrupt it then I will do that," said Grewcock."It's up to the citing commissioner," said Ruddock."Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but it's something we'll talk about in selection this week," said Ruddock.Grewcock was sin-binned with Wales captain Gareth Thomas for retaliation.The player himself and his captain Jason Robinson have both said that the clash with Peel was accidental.Last June Grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against New Zealand.

Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)."The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG," said a CAS statement.Collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal.USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that.The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results.So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal.The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer.

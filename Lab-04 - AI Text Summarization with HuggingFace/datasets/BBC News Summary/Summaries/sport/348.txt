"Gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain," said Owen.Wales number eight Michael Owen says replacing Gareth Thomas as Wales' captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad.Like us they did well in France and were unlucky not to get a win.Ruddock praised Owen's contribution as vice-captain and pack leader in this year's wins over England, Italy and France, notably his role in the second-half in Paris following Thomas' injury.Coach Mike Ruddock says the 24-year-old should take the armband from broken thumb victim Thomas against Scotland."You dream about playing for Wales, but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country," he said.Owen admitted the Grand Slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no-one was getting carried away with the three victories over England, Italy and France.

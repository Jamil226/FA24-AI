Kenteris's lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, said: "The decision means Mr Kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career."This evidence shows Mr Kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the International Olympic Committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one."In no way was he (Kenteris) informed to appear for a doping test.But the Greek Athletics Federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the IAAF can now contest at the Court of Arbitration for Sport."He has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in January.Sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal.But the IAAF said it was "very surprised" by the verdict.Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics.The head of that tribunal, Kostas Panagopoulos, said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in Athens.

Goals: Bowyer 35, Dyer 69.But the home side survived, and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half.Bolton: Jaaskelainen, Hunt (Fadiga 14), N'Gotty, Ben Haim, Candela, Giannakopoulos, Okocha (Vaz Te 77), Hierro (Campo 64), Speed, Gardner, Davies.Alan Shearer's snap-shot was charged down and Dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing Jaaskelainen from six yards.Goals: Giannakopoulos 41.Bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the Magpies."In the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure, and our goal matched theirs in quality.Lee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross.But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearer's shot was blocked and firing into the top corner.Newcastle: Given, Carr, Boumsong, Bramble, Babayaro, Dyer, Faye, Bowyer, Robert (Jenas 77), Ameobi, Shearer."We had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that.Kieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Bolton's 10-game unbeaten run.Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.Fernando Hierro cynically chopped down Dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through.Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearer's low shot and Dyer's close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note.

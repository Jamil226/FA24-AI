It was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early.Every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to Brian and Gordon.It was great work by Brian and I always knew I had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee.The different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult.It was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it.It was very physical and fair play to the Italians they made us work very hard for our victory.Their organisation was very, very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by.That new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half.I was very impressed the way the Scots played against the French on Saturday.Eddie (O'Sullivan) was very calm at half-time even though we were only 8-6 ahead.So really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball.

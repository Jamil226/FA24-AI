And Hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership.In Italy the break was very short."The break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead.He said: "If we talk about football at elite level, which the Premiership is, then I would support a winter break.Hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: "As I said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.Hodgson added: "The length of breaks can vary.Former Blackburn boss Roy Hodgson says the Premiership should follow the rest of Europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the English elite's bid for Champions League glory.Hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout Europe, although not in England - where the Champions League contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list."The bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the Premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the Champions League in February.""If you examine the demands of the Premier League and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally."

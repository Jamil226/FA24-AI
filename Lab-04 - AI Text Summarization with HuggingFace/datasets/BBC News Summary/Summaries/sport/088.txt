"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed.After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: "Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs."Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes.But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme."Mr Conte is simply not credible.We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed."Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte "for further information".

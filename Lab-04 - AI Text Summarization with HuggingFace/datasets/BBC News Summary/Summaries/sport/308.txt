He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand.Wales fly-half Stephen Jones was another player who impressed me.He gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side.One player who didn't impress me was Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel.Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there.Gordon D'Arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but I think you could get a Henson, D'Arcy, O'Driscoll combination in the Lions midfield.The player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting XV over the weekend was Gavin Henson.Cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward.He ran some good lines against Italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although Italy defended man on man which made it easy for him.They had good possession and he kicked the ball away - I wouldn't want him as my Lions scrum-half after that.He showed he can control a game.With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly-half.The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.Jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than Charlie Hodgson after Saturday's game.

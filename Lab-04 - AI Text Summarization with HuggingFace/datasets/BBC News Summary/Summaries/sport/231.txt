"I see one referee in the first half and another in the second," said Mourinho.Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will not face any Football Association action over the comments he made after their Carling Cup tie with Manchester United.Mourinho intimated that United boss Sir Alex Ferguson influenced referee Neale Barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time.Mourinho was concerned that Ferguson's conversation with Barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official."The referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks.But an FA spokesman told BBC Sport: "We are not taking action over Mourinho.Referees chief Keith Hackett believes Mourinho should retract his comments about Ferguson and Barry as he believes the Blues boss has questioned their integrity.For the second leg we have an experienced referee, and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing.Mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final.He should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him, but there was also someone else."

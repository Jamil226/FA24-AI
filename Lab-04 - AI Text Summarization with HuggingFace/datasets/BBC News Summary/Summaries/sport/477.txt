"No one was more concerned (about the injury) than myself," said eighth seed Agassi."I think this was the most important win of my life as Carlos is one of the best players in the world," he said.Fifth seed Carlos Moya was the first big name to fall at the Australian Open as he went down to fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez on Monday.Moya said: "I was playing well before I came here.Four-time champion Andre Agassi began what could be his last Australian Open with a convincing win over German qualifier Dieter Kindlmann.The 2002 champion Thomas Johansson fought back to beat Peter Luczak 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 6-3 4-6 6-0, and French Open champion Gaston Gaudio beat Justin Gimelstob 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 6-3.It was the perfect preparation but something was wrong today."Garcia-Lopez was delighted with the victory in only his third ever Grand Slam match.

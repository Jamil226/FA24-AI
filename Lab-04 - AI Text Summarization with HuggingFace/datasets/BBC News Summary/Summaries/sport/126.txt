Dundee United manager Ian McCall has won a reprieve from the sack, with chairman Eddie Thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future.Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their side's 3-0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South."Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup," he added."However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up.On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One."It (Dundee United) is my team."I can appreciate the rumours because I've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United.It is understood that McCall would have been sacked if Sheffield Wednesday manager Paul Sturrock had been willing to return to Tannadice."I've only been here five months and I don't expect to be leaving very, very soon," he said.We must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel," said Thompson.

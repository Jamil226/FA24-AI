No Ireland team lining up to play England will ever fall into that trap," he said.This England team has so much experience and skill.He added: "The only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think.Ireland and Munster lock Paul O'Connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.O'Connell, who made a try-scoring international debut against Wales two years ago, is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby's shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the Lions."Every time we play England we know what a big task it is.That's the one thing that makes me cringe."O'Connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job, but says he is totally focused on Sunday's Six Nations crunch clash with England."I came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6, and ended up getting hammered 42-6, so I know what can happen when England come to Dublin.Look at what they did to us two years ago.

England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating.The game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way.There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport's "blazers".Brian O'Driscoll's winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight.Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end.Lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control.It was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France.And Ronan O'Gara's tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component.Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece.However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown.The first was Denis Hickie's brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner.Sunday's explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948.Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on.Ireland's second-row colossus Paul O'Connell was equally superb.

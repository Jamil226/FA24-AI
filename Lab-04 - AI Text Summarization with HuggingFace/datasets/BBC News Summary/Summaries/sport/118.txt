I would keep Gerrard.Parry labelled the deal "an eye-opener" and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities.BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...  Captain Gerrard is central to Liverpool's plans and Parry's insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent.As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish.Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.Parry has to deliver a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above £120m.He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool.He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium.Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenal's stunning £100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape.BBC Sport reflects on the future for Liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive Rick Parry.Chief executive Parry is the man at the helm as Liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history.Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.I would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re-shaped Liverpool's thinking.£50m for Gerrard?Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez.He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'Anfield', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.Throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain Steven Gerrard, and you can see Parry is a man with a lot on his plate.

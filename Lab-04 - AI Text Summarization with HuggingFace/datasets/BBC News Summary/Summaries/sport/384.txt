Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned.Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham.Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory.A late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback.Cunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S. Best, Shields, Moore, Frost, McCullough, Ward, Feather, N. Best."Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time," said McCall.Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try.First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward.The speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion.

"It was difficult because I had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that I would play," said Ferrero.Among the low points of a difficult year for Ferrero was the decision of Spain captain Jordi Arrese to drop him for the Davis Cup final against the USA."It was difficult for me not to be in the Friday matches but I had to understand."Physically I am 100% since December of last year," said Ferrero.Former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005."When I started to come back I had my rib broken when I fell on court and that was another two months out."In the past when I was a top seed I would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi-finals.Despite this, Ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season."The difficult moments were when I knew that I had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover."Inside me I wanted to play but this was the decision of the captain and they had to make it."

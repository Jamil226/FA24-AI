Double Olympic 10,000m champion Haile Gebrselassie will race in the London Marathon for the next three years."It is a coup for us to secure Haile's presence for the next three years and it guarantees a quality race," said race director David Bedford."If I didn't think I could win I would not be here," said Gebrselassie, who has set world records on 18 occasions in his illustrious career and is keen to add the marathon record to his collection.

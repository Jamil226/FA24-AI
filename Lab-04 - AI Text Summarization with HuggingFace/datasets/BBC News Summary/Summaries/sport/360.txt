England coach Andy Robinson says English rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players' careers.The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players' Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby."If we don't the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this."As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an "injury audit" to find out how players are coping.Rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago.

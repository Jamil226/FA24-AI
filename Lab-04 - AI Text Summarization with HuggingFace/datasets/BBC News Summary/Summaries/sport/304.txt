Wales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturday's game with Italy because of injury.The centre was Wales' hero in the 11-9 Six Nations win over England, landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game.Meanwhile, Mike Ruddock may make Gavin Henson his first-choice kicker in Rome."Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something we'll talk about in selection this week," Wales coach Mike Ruddock told BBC Sport Wales.Parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over England, and Tom Shanklin is expected to continue at centre.

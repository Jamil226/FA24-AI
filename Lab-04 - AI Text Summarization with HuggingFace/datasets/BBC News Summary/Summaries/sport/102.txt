Steven Gerrard has admitted that Liverpool have little chance of winning the Champions League this season."We're fighting for the fourth spot for the Champions League for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions, which are very important.Last season he described qualification for the Champions League as the "be all and end all" - and rumours persist that he will leave Anfield if the Reds fail to secure a place in the competition."We are confident we can upset Chelsea in the Carling Cup final and get to the last eight of the Champions League because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good."The Reds are currently fifth in the Premiership table, five points off the crucial fourth spot, which brings Champions League qualification - and they face Chelsea in Sunday's Carling Cup final."Let's be realistic, there are some fantastic teams left in the Champions League," he told BBC Radio Five Live.

Henson was twice repelled as Wales laid siege to the English line after Charlie Hodgson's penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time.There were still four minutes for Wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that Henson could not even hear Jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away.And, thanks to Henson, Wales did.But it was Wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax.Henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for Shane Williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing Jamie Noon to fumble the ball into touch.One game into his Six Nations career, and Gavin Henson is already a Welsh legend.His kicking game also prospered, particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain Gareth Thomas was in the sin-bin.The England centre will have spent his 19th birthday on Sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once, but twice, by Henson's all-enveloping tackles.But he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din, and the outcome of the match fell to him."It was out of Steve's range but I looked at Gavin, and he gave me a reassuring nod," said Thomas.Five metres in from the right touchline, 44 metres out, it was not a kick Stephen Jones, who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar, would have approached with confidence.

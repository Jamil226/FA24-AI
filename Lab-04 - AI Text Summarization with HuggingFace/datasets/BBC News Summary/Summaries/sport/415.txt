England will have to take on Ireland in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle boss Rob Andrew.Meanwhile, former England full-back Dusty Hare put England's mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness."You need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over, but great goal-kickers like Jonny Wilkinson come along very rarely.""Jonny Wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate," Hare told BBC Radio Five Live.Wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 February match for his international comeback - has been missed by England, not least for his goal-kicking."They've probably got two of the best English kickers in the Premiership in Hodgson and Barkley," added Andrew, a former England fly-half and goal-kicker.The 25-year-old has not played for England since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries."Jonny's not fit yet," Falcons chief Andrew told BBC Radio Five Live.Hodgson, who has an excellent kicking record with club side Sale Sharks, has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late.

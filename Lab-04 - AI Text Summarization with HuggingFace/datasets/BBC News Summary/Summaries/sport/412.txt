Wing Christophe Dominici says France can claim another Six Nations Grand Slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against Scotland and England."We know our display was not perfect, but we can still win the Grand Slam, along with Ireland and Wales."But although France have yet to click, Dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili continues in his goalkicking form.France take on Wales at the Stade de France on 26 February and Ireland in Dublin on 12 March."The English played better than us but lost, whereas we are still in the race for the Grand Slam," said Dominici.France , Ireland and Wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year's RBS Six Nations, with the two Celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby.

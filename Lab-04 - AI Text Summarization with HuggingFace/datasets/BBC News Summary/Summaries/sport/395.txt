But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris.Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as "one of the great performances of the past three decades".So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits.Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33-5 in Paris two years ago.And can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978?"The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class," noted coach Mike Ruddock.If England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats.Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light.A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: "There was a French half and there was a Welsh half".The  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second-half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.

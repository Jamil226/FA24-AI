And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens.And if she lost, people would say her career was over.I was speaking to Paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation.If Paula's last experience of the year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism.It was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning.Now Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.Even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it.But that was never on the cards.She thought that if she won, people would say "why couldn't she do that in Athens?"

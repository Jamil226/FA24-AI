"If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team," he said."It wasn't the best display but it's all about the result," the Irishman said.It was a professional sort of performance," the Dutchman said.Looking ahead to the quarter-final, Jol said: "Newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult."He conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch."They're on a high, but we're confident and in the last few games we've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win," he said."We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come."

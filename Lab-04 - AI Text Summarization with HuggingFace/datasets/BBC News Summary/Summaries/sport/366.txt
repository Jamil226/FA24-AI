At his lowest ebb Lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for New Zealand again.Coming back to rugby, people said 'you are dreaming' but it always starts off with a dream."The match on 4 June will be my first 15-man game but I have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things," said Lomu.But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: "As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus."I actually started training three weeks after my operation but I was very limited until a few months ago.Opinion has been divided on whether Lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation."I have got so much energy since my operation that I train three times a day, six days a week."I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would.

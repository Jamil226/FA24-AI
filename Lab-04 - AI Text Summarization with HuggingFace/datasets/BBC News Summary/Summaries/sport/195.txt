Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would "desperately like to stay at Celtic" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted."I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there," said Hassel.The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park.In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic."Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.It would not be a bad move for him."Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans.But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions.He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer.Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest.

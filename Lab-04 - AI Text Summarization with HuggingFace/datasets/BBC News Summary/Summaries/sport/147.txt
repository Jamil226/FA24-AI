"We don't know how many red cards he was shown," said an SFA statement.Rangers' striker Dad Prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from Craig Gordon and leaving the Hearts keeper on the ground."But people have got to take into account why he was incensed."But it was over-zealousness and I don't think Hugh had any option."Hearts' boss John Robertson said: "Mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee's chest and got a red card for it."He was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we don't know if he did something else after the whistle."Prso was sent off for two cautions, and that will just be a one-match suspension."Rangers' boss Alex McLeish accepted referee Dallas had no option but to send Prso off.

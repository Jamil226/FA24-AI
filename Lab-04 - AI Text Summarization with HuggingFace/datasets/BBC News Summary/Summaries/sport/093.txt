Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance."But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me."I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken," says the Waterford man."In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.""My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed.But training is just part of the process of getting back.Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident."It's all about trying to get mobility in my back.He says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk.Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about.Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much."I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work.He then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January."That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again."I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake."All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006.

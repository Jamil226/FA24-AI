"At that meeting Bellamy admitted to Graeme and I that he had told the players that he was going to "fake" an injury in training and walk off."When I heard what the manager was saying I was in shock," Bellamy said.But even before Newcastle said the player would not be sold, Bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request.Newcastle have fined their Welsh striker Craig Bellamy two weeks' wages - about Â£80,000 - following his row with manager Graeme Souness."In my book this is cheating on the club, the supporters, the manager and his own team-mates.Bellamy's claim that Souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by Shepherd, who accused the striker of "cheating" the club."This club means so much to me.It is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club."I wish to put the record straight regarding the Bellamy situation," said Shepherd."I'd play anywhere for this club, even in goal."I don't want the fans to think for one minute that I wouldn't play for this club," he said.The difficult relationship between Souness and Bellamy boiled over at the weekend, and has led to a war of words in the media.

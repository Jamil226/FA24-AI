"So many of the major England players have either retired in the last year or are injured that I think it will be very hard for them down in Cardiff," Wood added.Former captain Keith Wood believes Ireland can win only their second Grand Slam - and first since 1948 - in this year's RBS Six Nations Championship.After claiming their first Triple Crown for 19 years last season, Wood tips his former team-mates to go one better."For Ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free, and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far," Wood added."Wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams."Ireland's last game of the tournament is against Wales in Cardiff - a fixture they have not lost since 1983.

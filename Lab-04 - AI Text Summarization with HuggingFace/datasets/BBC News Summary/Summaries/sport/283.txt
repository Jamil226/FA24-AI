"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.""It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career.Spurs boss Martin Jol said his team were "robbed" at Manchester United after Pedro Mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given."What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays.Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay.Jol added: "We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal."When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence," said Wenger."But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on."But at the end of the day it's so obvious that Pedro's shot was over the line it's incredible.He said: "My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate."What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.

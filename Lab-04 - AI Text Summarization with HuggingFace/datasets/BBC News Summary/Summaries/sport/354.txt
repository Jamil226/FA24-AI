But, like O'Sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it.But O'Sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season.Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season's Six Nations Championship.Already Ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season.He has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season's championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed.Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle.Ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.O'Sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come.After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder.That became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season.However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight.Under the burden of great expectations, Ireland have crumpled.

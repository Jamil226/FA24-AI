Hewitt said he had had a "gutful" of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but Tennis Australia's Geoff Pollard rejected his comments."We did ask for it to be made faster than last year and, to my knowledge, it is faster," he said.The tournament starts on 17 January, and Pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year's tournament following complaints by several Australian players.Hewitt, who has not got past the fourth round at Melbourne in seven attempts, had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament.

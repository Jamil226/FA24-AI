Bogdanovic, three years Murray's senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain's Davis Cup umbrella.Tim Henman's decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill."Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim's mantle," said Bailey.The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.While Murray has been marked out as Britain's golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003.Bailey said: "It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up.And Great Britain's last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996.Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements.And Bailey said: "Despite that, Alex is clearly talented as well, while Arvind is another contender."They're among the guys who have experienced the intensity of Davis Cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines.But Bailey does see some hope for the future.

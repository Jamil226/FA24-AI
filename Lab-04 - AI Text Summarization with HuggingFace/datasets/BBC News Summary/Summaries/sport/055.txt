Kelly Holmes has been forced out of this weekend's European Indoor Athletics Championships after picking up a hamstring injury during training."On Saturday night I pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night," said Holmes.Holmes has now been advised by her coach Margot Jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer.After that race and more progress in training, Holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the European Indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend."I saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but it's frustrating missing Madrid when I knew I was in great shape."

Birmingham have confirmed Blackburn made a bid for Robbie Savage - but managing director Karen Brady has called it "derisory"."A lot is said and written about Sav but he has been terrific for Birmingham City the last two and a half years," he said.Savage's future at Birmingham has been the source of speculation for several weeks, with some fans criticising his performances for the club earlier in the season.Birmingham manager Steve Bruce insists he does not want to sell Savage."The crowd gave me a massive standing ovation when I came off on Saturday which was nice," he said.But Brady told The Sun the bid was "a waste of fax paper and my time"."It was fantastic even though I was criticised by a number of them in recent weeks and on Saturday it showed how much I mean to them."It's not for me to say (about transfer rumours), it's between the two clubs.

Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.And he added: "It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot.Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March.Robben, who has been a key part of the Blues' push for four trophies, claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder Aaron Mokoena."But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months.""I felt it straight away after Mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot."Robben had an MRI scan on the injury, sustained during the Premiership win at Blackburn, on Monday.

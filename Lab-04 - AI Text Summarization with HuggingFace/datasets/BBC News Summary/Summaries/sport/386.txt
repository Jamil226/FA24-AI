Former government communications chief Alastair Campbell will act as a media consultant to Sir Clive Woodward's 2005 Lions on their tour to New Zealand.Campbell, who left Downing Street earlier this year, will advise on media strategy before and during the tour.Woodward's decision to call in Prime Minister Tony Blair's former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last Lions tour of Australia in 2001, when New Zealander Graham Henry was the head coach."I hope I can contribute to the planning and preparation, and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself," he said."[Alastair] will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself."The Lions is a massive media event," said Woodward, who will be the head coach.

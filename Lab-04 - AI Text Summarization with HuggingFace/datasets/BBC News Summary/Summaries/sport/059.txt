Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah.But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted.The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her.A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance.It was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.The best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles.He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has.In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka.In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him.She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that.Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain.I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there.Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him.

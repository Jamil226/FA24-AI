Ken Bates has completed his takeover of Leeds United.Outgoing Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner said: "This deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and I believe Mr Bates' proposals are totally for the benefit of the club.I recognise Leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times."When we took over Leeds United in March 2004, the club had a debt of £103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under £25m."We are content that under Mr Bates, Leeds United will continue to consolidate and move forward.On Leeds' new-look board it is understood that Lorimer will be joined by former Chelsea finance director Yvonne Todd and Bates' lawyer Mark Taylor.The club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of 10 points by the Football League - before Bates' arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.The 73-year-old former Chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 GMT on Friday, and has bought a 50% stake in the club.For the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again."Bates stepped down as Chelsea chairman in March last year following Roman Abramovich's £140m takeover at Stamford Bridge.Krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over.Sebastien Sainsbury had been close to a takeover of Leeds but withdrew his £25m offer last week.His efforts failed after he revealed it would take £40m to stage a takeover, and that the club will also lose £10m over the next six months.

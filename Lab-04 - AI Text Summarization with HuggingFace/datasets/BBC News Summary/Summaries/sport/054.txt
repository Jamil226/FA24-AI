I am confident and optimistic," said Thanou."We were asked [by the disciplinary committee] all kinds of questions about the night of 12 August," said Tzekos.The athletes' lawyer Grigoris Ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the Greek Athletics Federation (SEGAS) would find them innocent.Tzekos, Thanou and Kenteris, who have all denied the charges, can expect a decision within a month.Katerina Thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter Kostas Kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Thanou, the 2000 Olympic women's 100m silver medallist, and Sydney 200m champion Kenteris were suspended by the IAAF for missing three drugs tests."We are almost certain that the charges will be dropped," said Ioanidis."Deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by Thursday," said committee chairman Kostas Panagopoulos.

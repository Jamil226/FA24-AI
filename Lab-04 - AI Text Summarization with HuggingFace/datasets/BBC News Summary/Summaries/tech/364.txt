"It is totally going to kill the business model of radio," thinks Curry."Podcasting is going to be a medium of niches, with 'audiences' measured in the single digits, like e-mail or blogs.Because of the way podcasts work, based on RSS, the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets."We're the sources, the people doing stuff, and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we're doing."I should be knighted for this," he adds, with a wry chuckle, "People are going to be so happy to sit at home, make their podcast, and make a little money.""Podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid."It's about real people saying real things and communicating," says Adam Curry, former MTV VJ and the Pied Piper of podcasting."No matter how you look at it, commercialising this medium isn't going to make very much money," he says.Those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like, and subscribe - for free - to that show's "feed".The creative forces behind radio are elated, says Curry.Others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative."When you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience.It is a fledgling movement, but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it.Curry and associate Ron Bloom's new venture, called PodShow, is to help ordinary people produce, post, distribute and market their podcasts.It is podcasting - DIY radio in the form of downloadable MP3 audio files.He was one of a community of people who created iPodder, a small computer program, known as an "aggregator".They are essentially amateur radio shows on the net, on demand, and the "movement" is at very early stages."So how are they going to reach these audiences?Advertising, in his eyes, can be tailored to podcasts, to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive.Ian Fogg, Jupiter Research analyst, thinks there could be potential for business, but it could take an interesting turn if big companies, like Apple and Microsoft, get involved.They can done by anyone who has a microphone, simple software, the net, and something to say.Some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days.It is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over," he says.One, Eric Rice, has won sponsorship from Warner Bros.

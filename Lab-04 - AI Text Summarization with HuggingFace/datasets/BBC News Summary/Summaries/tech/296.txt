The explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in Las Vegas, have been told.The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) featured the pick of 2005's products.The portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of CES, which was the "time and place shifting" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time.Another disappointment was the lack of exposure Sony's new portable games device, the PSP, had at the show.A Sony representative told the BBC News website this was because Sony did not consider it to be part of their "consumer technology" offering.He unveiled new ways of letting people take TV shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices."Everything is going digital," Kirsten Pfeifer from the Consumer Electronics Association, told the BBC News website.Hybrid devices, which combine a number of multimedia functions, were also in evidence on the show floor.As well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable MP3 players to giant high-definition TVs, several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders, such as Microsoft chief Bill Gates."All the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry."That figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players, personal video recorders and digital cameras.More than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers, according to CEA research.

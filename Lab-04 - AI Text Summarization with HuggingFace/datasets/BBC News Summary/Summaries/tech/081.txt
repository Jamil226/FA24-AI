Almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden.Said the Pew report: "This finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results."Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query.Internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits.The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine.A small number, 17%, said they wouldn't really miss search engines if they did not exist.Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web.Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes.

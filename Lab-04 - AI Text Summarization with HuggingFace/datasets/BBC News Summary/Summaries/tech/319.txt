The Cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple Cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously.If Cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future.By creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the Cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals.The speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the Cell is a huge leap in performance.The links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach Cell processors in entirely different systems.The world is casting its gaze on the Cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different?Intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop PC dominance.The technology inside the Cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint.This digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the Cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail.Sony will be using the chip inside its PlayStation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms.Traditional computers - whether they are household PCs or PlayStation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer.Each Cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power.You can also guarantee that Microsoft and Intel are not going to sit around and let Cell take over home computing without a fight.

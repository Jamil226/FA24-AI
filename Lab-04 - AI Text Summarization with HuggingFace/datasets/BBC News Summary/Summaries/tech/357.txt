Using a 'bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against.The detailed look at zombie or 'bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the Honeynet Project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as "honey pots" to attract hackers and gather information about how they work.The months of surveillance revealed that the different 'bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes.During the monitoring period, the team saw 'bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets.More than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses.The longest time a Honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes.Other 'bot nets were used to abuse the Google Adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine.The largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50,000 hijacked home computers.Getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy.While 'bot nets have been known about for some time, estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely.

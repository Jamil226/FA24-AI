The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed "blip-pop.""Gameboyzz Orchestra Project is more of an improvisational project," said Kudja.Malgorzata Kujda, Jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a Gameboyzz Orchestra Project concert as a lot of noise.Kujda found five other people who were interested and the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project was born.In the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique."I was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when I first used a GameBoy in my band as a drum machine," said Kujda.Jarek Kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now."But each of us makes another music, a different sound.He wondered, if one GameBoy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together?The members of the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project do not expect serious competition anytime soon.The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year.The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences.

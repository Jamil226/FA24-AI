The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan.In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps.Tata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network.The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network.An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections."In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task," said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata.In some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get.

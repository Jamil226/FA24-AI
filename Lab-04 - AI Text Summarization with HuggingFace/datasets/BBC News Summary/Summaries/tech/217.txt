But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month.Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.The number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months.Older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened.In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages.Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals.In its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals.

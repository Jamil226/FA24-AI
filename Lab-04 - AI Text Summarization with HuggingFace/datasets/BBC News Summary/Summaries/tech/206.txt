The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue," it said in a statement.We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses," it said.It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman."I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening," he said.Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience."You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault," he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research.At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network.While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said.Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading.Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website."Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience," he said.

The three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs.It will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said John Wyver, from TV producer Illuminations Television Limited, which is also involved in the project.One of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the TV audience.New Media for a New Millennium (NM2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre, which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes.This project is about teaching the machine to look at content like Lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense," he said.Other productions that the NM2 team will make range from news, documentaries to a romantic comedy drama."It's not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production," said Mr Wyver.Manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro (Â£5.1m) project funded by the European Union."At the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive TV which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows.It will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry, music and architecture.BT is one of 13 partners involved in the project.Viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots and even the sets and props of TV shows.

Microsoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser.The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser.In particular the Firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in November 2004.Microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals.Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system.A new version of IE was widely expected to debut with the next version of Windows, codenamed Longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006.Test versions of the new program, called IE 7, are due to be released by the summer.The current version of Internet Explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as Firefox and Opera.In a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware.Earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the IE browser.

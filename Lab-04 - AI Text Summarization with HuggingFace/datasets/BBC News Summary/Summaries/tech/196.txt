Mozilla browsers - including Firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market share, the figures suggest.While IE's market share has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, Mozilla browsers - including Firefox - have grown by 5%.Net traffic monitor, OneStat.com, has reported that the open-source browser Firefox 1.0, released on 9 November, seems to be drawing users away from IE.Firefox is made by the Mozilla Foundation which was set up by former browser maker Netscape in 1998."It seems that people are switching from Microsoft's Internet Explorer to Mozilla's new Firefox browser," said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of Amsterdam-based OneStat.com.Microsoft IE has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from Netscape, and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark.Other browser software, like Opera and Apple's Safari, are also challenging Microsoft's grip on the browser market.Firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005.Supporters of the open-source software in the US managed to raise $250,000 (Â£133,000) to advertise the release of Firefox 1.0 in The New York Times, and support the Mozilla Foundation.

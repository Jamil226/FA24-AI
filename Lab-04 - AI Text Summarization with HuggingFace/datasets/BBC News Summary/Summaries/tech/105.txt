A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old.IAEA inspectors make around 3,000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide.Such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide."Failure to replace the hardware and software, and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks," said an agency statement."A major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate, secure online access to information," said project manager Livio Costantini.The organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in November, aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data, design blueprints of nuclear facilities, even satellite images of the plant.The computer systems used to monitor the world's nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors.An IAEA spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack.

It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired.The study predicts that 40% of all home PC net security buyers will be women in 2005.Older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study.The study, for net security firm Preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers.But net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said.By the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of UK homes will have broadband net access.The research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said Mr Goosens, they are reported in the press much more.Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts.But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men.In July last year, the number of UK households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the Office of National Statistics.The number of women buying programs to protect PCs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004.More than 30,000 PCs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from Symantec showed last year.

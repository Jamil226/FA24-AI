Cable firms NTL and Telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable TV heats up.With both services on offer from Telewest, Mr Tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial TV but also gain a huge competitive advantage over Sky.Telewest customers in Bristol and NTL viewers in Glasgow will be the first to test the new service, which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental.NTL said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a PVR but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand."We offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and PVR," he said."Video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on TV.Telewest will launch similar services later in the year.The service is similar to Sky Plus, as users can pause, fast forward and rewind content, but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet.For Telewest it is the beginning of a Â£20m investment in TV-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (PVR)."It allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over Sky for the first time in many years," said Telewest chief executive Eric Tveter."While Sky will remain the dominant force in UK pay TV for some time to come, NTL and Telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of VOD enthusiasm and, if marketed correctly, this could help them eat into Sky's lead," he said.The BBC is trialling a similar service, offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their PC.

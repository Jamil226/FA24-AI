A spokesman for one US shop said it expected the device to sell out on its first day.The latest handheld gaming gadget, Sony's PlayStation Portable, goes on sale in the US on Thursday."The story of the PSP is it's not a gaming device as much as it is a portable entertainment device," said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.Sony has promised to have a million units ready for its US launch, but there are fears demand may not be met.The first million sold will come with the Spider-Man 2 film on UMD, Sony's own disc format for the device.The machine's European launch was put back "a few months" last week in order to make sure enough of the devices were ready for its US launch, as well as satisfying the Japanese market.It hopes to take a share of the handheld gaming market too.Nintendo dominates the handheld market, with more than a 90% share of the market in the US alone.Hundreds of gamers gathered at US shops, some waiting for more than 36 hours, to be the first to get their hands on the gadget.

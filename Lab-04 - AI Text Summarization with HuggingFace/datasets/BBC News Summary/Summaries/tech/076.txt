The net search giant Google has launched a search service that lets people look for TV programmes.Rival search engine Yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and TV clips which it promotes from its homepage.The service, Google Video beta, searches closed caption information that comes with programmes.It searches for and links to TV news, film trailers, and other video and audio clips.It only searches US channel content currently.The results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel, date and time."Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today," a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website.It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function.

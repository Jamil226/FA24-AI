Poland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software.The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US.Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones.Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas.The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic.

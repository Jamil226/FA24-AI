But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be "real".Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as "HD", but are in fact not able to display HD.By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the "true impact" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice.But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street.It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats.HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now.There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra.The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line.Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry."The UK is the largest display market in Europe," according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other.In most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour.

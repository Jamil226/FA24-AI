Computer giant Microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones.In June, the software giant said that the major security update to Windows XP, Service Pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system."This is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of Windows XP software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders", said Alex Hilton, licence compliance manager at Microsoft.Microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the UK programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.It is the first time Microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the BBC News website.The Windows XP Counterfeit Project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free, subject to certain conditions, until the end of the year.

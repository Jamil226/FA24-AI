It has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars, it would not stand up for long.The sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for.Speaking of noise, Battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the Star Wars galaxy's audio motifs.The warm reception that has greeted Star Wars: Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay, but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient.Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game.The number of combatants, noise and abundance of laser fire see to that, and the sense of chaos really comes over.The feel of those places is well and truly captured, with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic.There are also the dusty, sinister deserts of Tatooine and Geonosis, as well as the forest moon of Endor, where Return Of The Jedi's much-maligned Ewoks lived.Battlefront's novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast, leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game.In each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet.The multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar, as are the stirring John Williams symphonies that never let up.

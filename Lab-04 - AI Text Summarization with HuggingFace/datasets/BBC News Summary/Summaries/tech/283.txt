The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma.One of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation.The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma.The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences.But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game.By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all.A US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages."The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity," he said.This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons.Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes.But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games.

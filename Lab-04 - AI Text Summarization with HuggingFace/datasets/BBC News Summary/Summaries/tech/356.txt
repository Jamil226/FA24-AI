Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots.Hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet."We want to make the robots useful for people ...Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs.Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: "We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people."Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics.Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events.Robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human.If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated."Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot.The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month.

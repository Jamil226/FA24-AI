The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot.The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003."He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image," said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project.The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures.The finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras."All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves."Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite.That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs.

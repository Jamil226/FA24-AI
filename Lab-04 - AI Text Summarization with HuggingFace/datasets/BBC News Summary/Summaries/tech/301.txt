Apple offer a less powerful Mac Mini for £339 but the £399 models has a 1.4ghz Power PC chip, 80 gigabyte hard drive, combined CD burner/DVD player.A good basic PC that, according to PC Pro, has "superb upgrade potential"."This machine is for small businesses and for people who want a second computer for basic home use, perhaps in a kids bedroom," a spokesman for Dell said.The Mac mini is the cheapest Apple computer ever.For your money you get a 1.8GHz AMD Sempron processor, 512MB of Ram, 120GB hard drive, DVD writer, 16-inch monitor, mouse, keyboard and Windows XP2  Much more than the basics.Apple are targeting people who already have a main computer and want to upgrade - especially PC users who have used an Apple iPod.A desktop computer that PC Pro magazine dubbed best performer in a group test of machines that cost only £399 (£469 including VAT).The package of software that comes with the machine is the best money can buy.A surprisingly good PC sporting an AMD Athlon XP 2500 processor, 512 megabytes Ram, a graphics card with 128 Ram on board plus TV out, a 40 GB hard drive, CD-writer and DVD player, Windows XP Home.An entry-level machine designed for basic home use.The Mac mini is just a box.Wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost.It comes equipped with USB and Firewire ports for peripheral connections, Ethernet port for broadband, a port for standard video output and an audio/headphone jack.The machine comes with Mac OS X, the Apple operating system, the software suite iLife, which includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD and GarageBand.As Gavin Cox of the excellent buildyourown.org.uk website put it: "It will be tough to obtain/build a PC to ever be as compact and charming as the Mac mini.""The Mac Mini puts the Macintosh within the reach of everyone," an Apple spokesman said.The machine comes with Windows XP home edition."I think we offer better value once you realise all the extras needed for the Mac Mini."Compact and stylish, the Mac mini would not look out of place in any home.Nick Ross, deputy labs editor at PC Pro, said the important point about buying a cheap and cheerful PC is the upgrade path.The machine has 6 USB ports and an Ethernet port for broadband connection.A DVD burner, or any wireless components built in.Those on a limited budget who want a machine they can add to and improve as their cash allows.By contrast, says Mr Cox, the Mac mini is almost disposable.But though it is cheap for a Mac how does it compare to PCs that cost about the same amount?Macs don't offer the upgrade flexibility of a PC and the machine's specifications lack the horse power for tasks such as high-end video editing or games.

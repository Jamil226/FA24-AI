This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site.The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack.Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites.But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words "Stay tuned".The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, "Stay tuned".A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them.People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages.

"It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies," she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning.Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge," he said.Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market."We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational," said Mr Owen.It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.Already there are games on the market, such as Civilisation and Age of Empire, that have educational elements said Mr Owen.The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element.Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom."Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other," said Ben Williamson, a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools.Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research.'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market.

At times Half-Life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome.The game does have a couple of problems.Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through Half-Life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.The impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped.Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.After almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.Could Half-Life 2 possibly live up to the hype?It has the look of a beautiful Eastern European city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here.The player sees things through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 Half-Life.Considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications.It would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, Half-Life 2 is up to the challenge.The box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded.But the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run.In gameplay terms, HL2 somehow gets almost everything perfect.Luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings.The time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental Valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours.If you like things open-ended and free-ranging, Far Cry will be a lot more pleasing.A casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.Half-Life 2 is out now for the PCOn our test machine - an Alienware system with an Athlon 3500+ processor and ATI's Radeon X800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping.

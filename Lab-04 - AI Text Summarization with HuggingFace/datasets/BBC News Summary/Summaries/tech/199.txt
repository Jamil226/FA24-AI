The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might.Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about $10 a month, and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities."It must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this," Prof Reddy says."I come from a village," says Prof Reddy, "I know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns."Reddy says he can then introduce the PCtvt's other technologies - such as video mail.Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people.Prof Reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off.Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley.Instead, Prof Reddy decided to think of those 250 million Indians as a potential market.Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV.You might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer."So it's clear to me that if people wanted to use PCs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice."Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach.Prassana Rambathla, one of Prof Reddy's graduate students, says that "when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.'After all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate Indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world?If you go to India, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal.This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD.The answer, says Prof Brewer, is wi-fi.And now, an Indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet.

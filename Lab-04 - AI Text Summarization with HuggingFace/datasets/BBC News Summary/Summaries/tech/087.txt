The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said.Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option.As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT.In fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free.In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content.Content on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm.More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web.Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net.Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.There is no watershed on the net," said Mr Burke.Some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net.At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.

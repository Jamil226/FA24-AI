The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that, said Ms Rellie.If you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting.Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures.It 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them.ArtGarden, developed by BT's research unit, is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings.BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection.For Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration.

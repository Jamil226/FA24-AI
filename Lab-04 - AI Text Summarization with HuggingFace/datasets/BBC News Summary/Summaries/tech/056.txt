But that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when ESPN sold EA the rights to its TV branding and on-air talent, meaning the ESPN games presently developed by Sega will have to come to and end in their present form.On the same note, the ESPN 2k5 and EA sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements.The ESPN games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans.Sports broadcaster ESPN, meanwhile, has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price.So, will the Sega - ESPN range be missed?They also both look awesome, with the Sega / ESPN versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front.The current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch.The two giants in the field - ESPN and EA Sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the ESPN deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of EA's future titles.

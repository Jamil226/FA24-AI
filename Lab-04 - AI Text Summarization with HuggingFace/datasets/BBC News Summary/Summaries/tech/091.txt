The Movie Association for America's (MPAA) free Parent File Scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peer-to-peer programs.The body that represents the US movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing, aimed at parents.It will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive.The industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the US, but did not say how many were being sued.Mr Glickman said that the film industry was embracing "digital age technologies", like Movielink and CinemaNow, which are legal movie sites.The MPAA said files found would not be passed on to it.The first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the US in January.

A speech on mobile TV by Angel Gambino of the BBC also drew a large crowd, suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile TV yet are starting to look into it.Mobile operators O2 and Vodafone are among the operators trialling mobile TV.Scandinavians and Koreans, two of the most adventurous groups of mobile users, are betting on mobile TV.But all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile TV arena.Samsung of South Korea has a DMB phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the TU Media satellite mobile TV service to be launched in Korea in May.Dr Chan Yeob Yeun, vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile TV at LG Electronics, said: "DMB offers twice the number of frames a minute as DVB-H and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly."SK Telecom of South Korea, which is launching a TV to mobile service (via satellite) in May plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio.Nokia, the Finnish handset maker, is planning a party in Singapore this spring to launch its TV to mobile activities in the region.The jury is still out on whether TV and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone.For those not convinced mobile users will want to watch TV on their handsets, Digital Audio Broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio."This will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on TV."

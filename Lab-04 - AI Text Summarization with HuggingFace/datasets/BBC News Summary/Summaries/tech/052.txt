Details of the next generation of Microsoft's Xbox games console - codenamed Xenon - will most likely be unveiled in May, according to reports.The next Xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year, but very few details about it have been released.At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine.It was widely expected that gamers would get a sneak preview of Xbox's successor at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March.Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months.Microsoft chief, Bill Gates, used the GDC event to unveil the original Xbox five years ago.But earlier this year, Microsoft said it had reached a European milestone, selling five million consoles since its European launch in March 2002.Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo's kits.But a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at GDC.

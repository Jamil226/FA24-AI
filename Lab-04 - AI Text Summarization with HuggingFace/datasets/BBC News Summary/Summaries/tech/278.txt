Many people's hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular.Photo giants such as Kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services."They are a place to store pictures, to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos."An increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections.Marcus Hawkins, editor of Digital Camera magazine, said: "As file sizes of pictures increase, storage becomes a problem.On Tuesday, Google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer's hard drive.Some services, such as Kodak's Ofoto and Snapfish, offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online.Mr Hawkins added: "The growth area is that you can order your prints online.The tool, called Picasa, automatically detects photos as they are added to a PC - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera.Friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too.

The lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall TFC 101 Tower in Taipei, Taiwan.The super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds, while ascending their 382m track.The Guinness Book of Records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on Earth.Curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the TFC Tower.The 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h).The key new technologies applied in the world's fastest elevators include:   - A pressure control system, which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers, preventing "ear popping" - An active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations - Streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft   "The certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative Guinness World Records is a great honour for us," said Masayuki Shimono, president of manufacturer Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems which installed the lifts.

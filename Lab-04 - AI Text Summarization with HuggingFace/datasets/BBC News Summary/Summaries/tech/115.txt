The technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements.Andrew Stoddart, chief scientist at 2d3, said that the EU project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life.It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii.Unlike virtual reality, which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer, the Lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views.The old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life.At Pompeii for example, the visitor would not just see the frescos, taverns and villas that have been excavated, but also people going about their daily life.Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements.

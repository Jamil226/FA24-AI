Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth.The growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine.But the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin."The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call," he said.As well as being a popular single-player title, Halo 2 can be connected to Microsoft's subscription-based broadband network, Xbox Live.In a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what.Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth, an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group.

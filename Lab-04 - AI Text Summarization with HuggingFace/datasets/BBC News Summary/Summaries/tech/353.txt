"Using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we're delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem," said Karen Walsh, from the UK National Tremor Foundation.A special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed.About three million Britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the UK National Tremor Foundation.People with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen.Computer users plug the device into a PC, and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is."The number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages, and at the same time, the need for computer access grows," he said."I'm a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane," he said.Most commonly associated with tremors is Parkinson's disease, but they can also be caused by other conditions like Essential Tremor (ET).The device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier.More than six million UK households now have a broadband net.

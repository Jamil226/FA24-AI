Mr Gupta says the power of Morquendi's text message blogs was palpable."He was running around, looking for friends, burying bodies, carrying bodies," Mr Gupta says of Morquendi.In one message, Morquendi wrote about a Sri Lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit."Imagine if they had this resource available to them, if there was a disaster, how quickly you could funnel aid in, and get people to help," she says.One Sri Lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name Morquendi.Then, says Mr Kotamaraja, the blogging world found out."She was being swept away," Morquendi's message read.In Sri Lanka, blogger Morquendi is recruiting others to help."We started publishing these SMSes," says Mr Gupta.With internet service disrupted by the tsunami, Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka.And this was coming through an SMS message.Mr Kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends."All my blogger friends started linking up my site, and I saw a lot of people other than my friends."I can't even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports, and doing the relief work at the same time."Well," Heretic writes, "that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you?"But in the wake of Sunday's tsunami, Mr Gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears.I'd say 70% of the donations came from people I don't know.She says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts.

But more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in US homes, said the EPA.But at CES, the EPA also unveiled new guidelines for its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters.The predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too.The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly Â£68 billion).The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005.But developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances.Although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget.The biggest culprit, according to the EPA, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed "energy vampires".At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment."We are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply," the EPA's Andrew Fanara said.Elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the EU by 2006.About two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the US alone.Ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and eBay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them.The EPA is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market."There is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free," Intel's Allen Wilson told the BBC News website.Mr Heine told the BBC News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes "learned behaviour".

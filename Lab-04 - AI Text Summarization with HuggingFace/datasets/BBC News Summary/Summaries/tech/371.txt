The French DTT platform is known as TNT, which stands for TV numerique terrestre or digital terrestrial television.France has become the last big European country to launch a digital terrestrial TV (DTT) service.Digital terrestrial TV will launch as a free-to-air platform to start with, adding pay-TV channels later.Up to 15 pay-TV channels will launch on DTT between September 2005 and March 2006.TNT expects between 700,000 and one million DTT set-top boxes to be sold in 2005.Almost 60% of UK households have gone digital on at least one television set through cable, satellite or Freeview.In the three months to September 2004, almost five times as many people signed up to the UK's free-to-air DTT service compared with Sky.A recent survey by Mediametrie found that 70% of people interviewed were aware of DTT, and 25% were planning to buy a digital receiver.Digital terrestrial set-top boxes are available from as little as 70 euros (Â£50).Recent figures from the UK's regulator Ofcom showed Freeview was more popular than the Sky digital satellite service."France is the poorest market in Europe in terms of free-to-air national channels, so it has the potential to be one of the biggest DTT markets," Mr Gerolami added in remarks quoted by the US entertainment industry paper Variety."We think free DTT could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay-TV in France," said Henri de Bodinat, vice-president of the Arthur D. Little consultancy.Despite the long wait for a French DTT roll-out, the new platform's backers hope to emulate the success of its UK free-to-air counterpart, Freeview.

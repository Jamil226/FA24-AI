Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people.Chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said.China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people.This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines.The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated.According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally.In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn.Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes.

Dr Frasca said: "Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games."When I started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen," said Gonzalo Frasca, computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen.The first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the Iowa Game, commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean."It will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns."The phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.After bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.But experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns."I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved," added the Uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns."Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation," Mr Frasca told the BBC News website."It's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games."

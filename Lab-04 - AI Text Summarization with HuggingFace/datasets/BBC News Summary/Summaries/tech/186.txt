"China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports," said the group in a statement."It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue," said a Google spokesperson.Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources.China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders.But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links.The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information.It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports.Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes.

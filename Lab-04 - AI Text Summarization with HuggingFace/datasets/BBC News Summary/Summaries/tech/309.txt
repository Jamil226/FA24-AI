Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, said Mr Armes, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo to send kits.Although the details may not be nailed down, Mr Armes said EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines.Mr Dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles.Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months.Until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do, developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower.The next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers?In the first year at least, developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines.He said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles.Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles.The details of PlayStation 3, Xbox 2 (codename Xenon) and Nintendo's so-called Revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless."We know maybe what the PS3 will do, but we can only guess," said Rory Armes, studio general manager for video game giant Electronic Arts in Europe."PS3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies," said Mr Florin.What is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power.Gerhard Florin, head of EA in Europe, said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games."It's much smarter if you can get levels as you go."When he goes home he goes online and he could buy AI and levels as you go."We want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game.""We are working on new libraries of effects.

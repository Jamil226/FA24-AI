The British-backed gadget faces stiff competition from handheld gaming devices made by Nintendo and Sony.The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget goes on sale on Saturday.The PSP can also play music and movies and supports wireless multiplayer gaming.This too crams a fully functional phone into a gadget that also plays games.Although the device rolls together an impressive list of functions, it will face serious competition from three established names in mobile gaming: Nintendo, Nokia and Sony.Priced at £229, the handheld device is debuting in the UK and goes on sale in the US and mainland Europe in the next few weeks.Nintendo's DS handheld went on sale on 11 March and priced at £99 costs far less than the Gizmondo.It also works with GPS (Global Position System) so can also be used as a navigation aid or to support a variety of location-based services.The PSP is due to go on sale in the US later this month and a bundle including the player, accessories and a copy of Spiderman 2 is expected to cost about $250 (£129).

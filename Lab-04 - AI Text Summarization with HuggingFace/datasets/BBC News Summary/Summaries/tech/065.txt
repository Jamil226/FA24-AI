Jerry Yang, who remains the firm's "Chief Yahoo", is proud of what the company has achieved.Yahoo, one of the net's most iconic companies, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week.The web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang in a campus trailer."In just one decade, the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and it's been a remarkable and wonderful experience," he said.Originally dubbed "Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web" the firm adopted the moniker Yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude, unsophisticated, uncouth person.They did have business brains however, and in April 1995 persuaded venture capitalists Sequoia Capital, which also invested in Apple Computer and Cisco Systems, to fund Yahoo to the tune of $2m (Â£1.04m).

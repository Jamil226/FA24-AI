Part of the reason that these "bot nets" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created.By contrast, said Mr Hogan, the code for viruses such as Gaobot, Spybot and Randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time.One of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus, said Kevin Hogan, senior manager in Symantec's security response group.Mr Hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting PCs to take part in "bot nets" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.On the positive side, Finnish security firm F-Secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers.The emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004.Although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said Mr Hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs.In total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29A virus writing group were sentenced.The count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%.The Anti-Phishing Working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month.This change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages.Virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum."In June, the Cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using Bluetooth short-range radio technology."They are not an efficient way of spreading viruses," said Mr Hogan."That's unprecedented," said Mr Hogan.

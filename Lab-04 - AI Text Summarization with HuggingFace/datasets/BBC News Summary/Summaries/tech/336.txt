Another user has mounted his Mac Mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse.So - is the Mac Mini just another computer or a revolution in computing?But that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the Mac Mini to media centre uses.There is more to be said on the computer's size and design but it is worth highlighting that the Mac Mini is a just a computer.The Mac Mini comes bundled with Mac OS X, the operating system, as well as iLife 05, a suite of software which includes iTunes, web browser Safari, iPhoto, Garage Band and iDVD.The design of the Mac Mini is further evidence of a future when PCs are more than just bland, bulky boxes.One user has already created a "dock" to enable him to plug in and out his Mac Mini in his car.For people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a Mac Mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.Coupled with the lack of a TV tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the Mac Mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not.Let us say then that if the Mac Mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution."It's just a Mac, but we should be very excited - it's revolutionary in its size (smaller than PCs), looks (looks better than PCs), and the fact that it's the first Mac designed to really go for the low-cost PC market."Let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes, the Mac Mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired Apple design.But for the value the Mac Mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, Apple is to be congratulated.A media centre computer has to store music, files and photos and as such 80GB just seems too small.

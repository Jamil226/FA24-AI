In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it.The research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts."In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession," said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director.It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February.BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing.Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different.The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive."I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost."About three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival.The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs.During its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed.

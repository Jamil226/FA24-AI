"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure," he said.The Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets.The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call."In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call."There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people," said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels.Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter."By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group."

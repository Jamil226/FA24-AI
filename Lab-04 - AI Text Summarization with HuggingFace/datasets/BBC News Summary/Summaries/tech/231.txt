Ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry.Violent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February.This was the focus of the talks between government officials, representatives from the games industry and the British Board of Film Classification.The issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on Sunday by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt."Industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn't play."Among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience, as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.The issue was discussed at a meeting between UK government officials, industry representatives and the British Board of Film Classification.His mother, Giselle, said her son's killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game.And this Christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles.

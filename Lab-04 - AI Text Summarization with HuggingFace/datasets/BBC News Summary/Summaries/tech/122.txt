Already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them."Windows cash machines have been around for several years," he said.The many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously, he said."This could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system," he said.This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.Mr Thiemann said research by the TowerGroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were Windows based.Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system.But Mr Hirsch from Retail Banking Research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.Incidents like this happen, said Mr Thiemann, because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers.Todd Thiemann, spokesman for anti-virus firm Trend Micro, said the move to Windows in cash machines was not without risks.In January 2003 the Slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.Currently, he said, a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all ATMs get swapped for a newer model every year.

For its part, the long-running Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun.On a near-identical note, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action.Call of Duty on PC was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready.Of the two games, Pacific Assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.The acclaimed PC title Call of Duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements.The game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that.Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented.It is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game.Finest Hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the PC original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming.The mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety.The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.Call of Duty: Finest Hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on World War 2 battlefronts including Russia and North Africa.It is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you.Both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along.This notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic.

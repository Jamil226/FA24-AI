She said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12,500 interactions.The TfL campaign using the posters will run until Boxing Day.When interrogated with a mobile phone, the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home.The posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an IR port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster.Nigel Marson, head of group marketing at Transport for London (TfL), said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks.Although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, Ms Harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips."We started with infra-red because there are a huge number IR phones out there," said Rachel Harker, spokeswoman for Hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters.The posters are part of Transport for London's Safe Travel at Night campaign.

The Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world.It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities."Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world," said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve.The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong.

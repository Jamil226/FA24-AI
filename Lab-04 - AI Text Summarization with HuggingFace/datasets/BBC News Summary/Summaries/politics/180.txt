Concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia "through the back door" were not a political ploy, the lord chancellor has said.Tony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill.It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a "sensible solution", he said.Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer.Lord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords.The revolt was also reduced by news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill.He told BBC News: "We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life."It is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen," he said.He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear.On Tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs.

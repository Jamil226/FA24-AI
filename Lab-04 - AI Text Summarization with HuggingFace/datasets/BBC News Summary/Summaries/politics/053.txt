Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was "very happy" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985.Viktor Makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the British authorities, who promised he would live like an "average British citizen".But Mr Makarov's case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies.But he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him."I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold," Mr Kahn said.But despite a Â£65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension.But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled.An ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street.Through his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service.Government sources told the BBC they had reached a final settlement with the former spy, which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.

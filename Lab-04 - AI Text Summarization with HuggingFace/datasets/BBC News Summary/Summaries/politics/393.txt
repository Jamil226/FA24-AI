But divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and Parliament.Divorce by Parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids, butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses.Until 1857, the only way in England to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an Act of Parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty.The archives do, of course, hold records of high (and low) politics too for both Houses of Parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in Norfolk.Among the records is the story of Jane Campbell, the first woman ever to divorce her husband.As well as making divorce history, Jane Campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time.Mr Prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally.The legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings, dating back to 1670, all recorded among the 325,000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in Parliament's Victoria Tower.Few realise that Westminster in effect has its own divorce den.This wealth of material has long been open to the public at the House of Lords Record Office, with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room.There are details of foreign nationals made British citizens by act of Parliament, including composer George Frideric Handel in 1727.For sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what's there online.That document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across London to mark the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes' conspiracy.

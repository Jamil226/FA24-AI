Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.Mike Hobday, from the league, said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police.The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was "impossibly difficult to determine" and open to different interpretations.And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.The Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law.And the BBC's Sarah Mukherjee, with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton, Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback.In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs.Before riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: "We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned."Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed."Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting.BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.

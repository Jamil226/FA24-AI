As Britain takes up its presidency of the G8 group of leading nations, Mr Blair said ministers had a big agenda for Africa.Mr Blair told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not "invade" the money Britain wanted to spend on Africa."For the first time we have a plan that won't just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within African countries and conflict resolution," he said.But he pledged that Africa - which sees a "preventable" tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict, disease and poverty - would not be neglected.UK aid to help the victims of the Asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from Africa, Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised.Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Friday that about 440 Britons were either dead or missing in the disaster.

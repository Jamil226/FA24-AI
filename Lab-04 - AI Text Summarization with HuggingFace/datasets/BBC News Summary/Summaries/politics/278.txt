Certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator Alan Milburn, in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish New Labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event.Both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters, with Labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the Tories' new headquarters in Victoria Street, just down the road from the Commons."Welcome to the unremittingly New Labour media centre," he said.So what is the gap between Labour and the Tories nowadays?One Starbucks, one Rymans and one small Greek cafe as it happens.And I'll bet he hadn't checked that one with Gordon Brown.

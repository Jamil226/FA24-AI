The Scottish Executive said ministers would be notified but it would "not be common practice" to sign approval.She said: "The Scottish Executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of Mr Ferguson was a matter for Carstairs.He said: "We understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for Michael Ferguson to be released unescorted from Carstairs.Ms Brankin said: "The first minister has called for a review of what has happened, we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this."Police said Ferguson posed a danger to the public.She said: "Ministers were told of that, notified of it, but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off."They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision.""The executive concedes that it is up to Scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it.Scottish Conservative leader, David McLetchie, said earlier it was "almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen".An executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report.The executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor "in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers".First Minister Jack McConnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded.

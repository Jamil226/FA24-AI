The Lib Dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support.The Lib Dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university, not in their home towns.The party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll.The figures assume all students will vote in their university town.Although the expected 5 May election would be during term time, students can vote by post.The Conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.He said: "Top-up fees put students off university, especially those from a poorer background.Some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered.Labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £3,000 a year, with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £3,000."They are committed to abandoning Labour's targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under Lib Dem plans students would even have to study near home."

The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years.Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said.He said he "totally condemned" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January.Some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the Freedom of Information Act's implementation on 1 January.Dr Lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner Richard Thomas.A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records".But the Tories want the information commissioner to investigate.Departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records.Liberal Democrat Alan Beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the Department of Constitutional Affairs - said if the claims were true, Whitehall was "acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act".

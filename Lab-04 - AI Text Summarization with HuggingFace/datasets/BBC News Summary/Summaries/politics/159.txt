The Conservatives would stand up for the "forgotten majority", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto.The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values.He says in the manifesto foreword: "They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair."Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain.Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans.And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder.The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said.Labour says the document offers only a return to a "failed Tory past".Labour's election slogan will be: "Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again".Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue "down the path of ever rising taxes".

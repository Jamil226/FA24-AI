Britain's young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups.Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents."It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups," said a Home Office spokesman.The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings.The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work.Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their "other cultural identities" alongside being British."It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged."Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years.The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.

Mr Sayeed has been MP for Mid-Bedfordshire since 1997.But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him, with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes.After the vote, Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election.Mr Sayeed had denied the claims, saying the suspension was "unjust and wrong" but he made an "unreserved" apology to MPs in the Commons chamber.Mr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen "well below the standards expected".The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed.

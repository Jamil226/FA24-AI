Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.But he said it was "absolutely disgusting" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity."Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's "chaotic" asylum system under Tony Blair.Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world's "genuine refugees".On Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans."If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven," said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council.People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused," he said.The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997.

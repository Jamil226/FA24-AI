London mayor Ken Livingstone has again refused to retract a Nazi insult made to a Jewish reporter.It has the power to suspended or bar him from office but Mr Livingstone said: "There must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years.On Tuesday, the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly.The mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 Olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs, who arrived in London on Tuesday.The mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of "examples of intrusion by journalists" into his, and his family's private life.At his weekly press conference on Tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise.The mayor then says: "Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?"Labour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is "standing by" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a "concentration camp guard".

The law lords said the measures were incompatible with European human rights laws.But Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression.Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: "Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.On Thursday, senior law lord Lord Bingham said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions "in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status".He said the weakness for the government's case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for British suspects.Lord Hoffmann said: "The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these."In a blow to the government's anti-terror measures, the House of Lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees.The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.Detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the UK's highest court has ruled.But that ruling was later overturned by the Court of Appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.

They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK's jurisdiction.And it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred "has been timely, open or effective", the judges said.The High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights.The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.Ministry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction.The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment.But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : "Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out.The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.Because we don't want people thinking that British soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it'," he said.But judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern Iraq were ruled out.

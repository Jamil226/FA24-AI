Mr Opik said: "Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act.In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defra's lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was "not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence"."If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence."How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away?""If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting."The new law banning hunting with dogs is "so poorly drafted" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say.He had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the Hunting Act.Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting.

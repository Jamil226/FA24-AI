"As Lord Woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice.Lord Woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns.In written evidence to the committee, Lord Woolf said: "I have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue ...Lord Woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence.Lord Woolf, who is Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, was giving evidence to the Commons public administration select committee's inquiry into public inquiries.But he told MPs the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, was insisting he should have the final say in such cases.The government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against Lord Woolf's wishes.A Department for Constitutional Affairs spokeswoman said Lord Woolf and Lord Falconer agreed about what happened in practice.He said he had not been involved in the choice of Lord Hutton, who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction."What I am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn't happen," he said.

"It was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable."Jack McConnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were "a recognition that people will get drunk"."He was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s," she said."We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk.Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking."The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that," he said.Scotland's first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk "once in a while".He has been criticised by the SNP for encouraging young people to get drunk.

The information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the Lib Dems about how Labour uses its call centres.A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour.The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls.His letter to the commissioner quotes from a Labour Party handbook about "identifying target voters"."For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote."And it quotes a Stevenage Labour Party members' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.Labour denies breaking rules.The Lib Dems raised worries about Labour and Conservative calls in February and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain.Labour says it avoids those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making "voter identification" calls.Mr Taylor tells the commissioner: "It is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the Labour Party is engaging in a large-scale voter ID project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.Asked about the commissioner's inquiry, a Labour spokesman told BBC News: "We expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously."As the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law.The party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.If Labour is judged to have broken the rules, it will be asked stop immediately.

The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice.We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about £750.Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure.We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around.With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that.We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that.Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority.They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support.We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda.We've called for the state pension to be increased from £79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £105.45.People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad.We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters.Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press.Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time.Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools.It is hard to say whether we will be successful.We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK.The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum.But they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting.We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs.

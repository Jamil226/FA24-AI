And he tells them that if they don't confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they'll get life.He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime.And if your partner does confess, you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life.In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row.The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off.The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in.Now, if you are prisoner confronted with this choice, your best bet is to confess.Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up.Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on.If your partner doesn't confess, you'll get off completely.Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime.And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going.It's no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms, or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on.It's often referred to as the "prisoner's dilemma", based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners.

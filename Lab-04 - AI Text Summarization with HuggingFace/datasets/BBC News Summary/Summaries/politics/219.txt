Ms Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers.Ms Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: "The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them.Ms Jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a "trigger" for tensions and violence.Cathy Jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the Scottish Executive campaign against sectarianism."That's the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games," she said.Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme, Ms Jamieson described Friday's meeting as "very productive" and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim."Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people."Last week Ms Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.

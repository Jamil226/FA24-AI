The simple fact was that under a new Labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, Mr Howard said.Mr Brown's Budget was not about what was good for the country, but "all about the interests of the Labour party," the Tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign.Mr Brown's council tax rebate for pensioners was Â£300 less than what the Tories were offering, Mr Howard said.People would face a "clear choice" at the election, either "more waste and higher taxes under Labour or lower taxes and value for money with the Conservatives", he said.Mr Brown liked to rattle off "magical balances conjured out of thin air" in a bid to convince people there was no "black hole" in the nation's finances, the Tory leader said.Everyone could see the chancellor's "sweeteners", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said.Labour's "faltering election campaign" would not be helped by the package of measures, Mr Howard added."Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."

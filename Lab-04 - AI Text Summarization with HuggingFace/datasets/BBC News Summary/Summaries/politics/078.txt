'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision."The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania."We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused," said the spokesman."The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries."A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children "and leave them to rot".The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims."We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities.""In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure."From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account," said Mr Hogg."We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said.Under the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the "best interest" of a child in their care.

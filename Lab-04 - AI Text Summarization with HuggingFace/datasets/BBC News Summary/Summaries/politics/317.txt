The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a "ceiling" on what the richest pay.It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement.They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down.The rate would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which they say would save at least £300m.Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of £500.The party says it would aim for a £5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a £7,000 allowance for the over-65s.The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland.

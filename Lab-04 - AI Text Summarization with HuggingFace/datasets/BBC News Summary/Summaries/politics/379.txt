Sir Ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers.Sir Ian Blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the Madrid bomb on Spain's general election last year.Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority it would be "unwise" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack.Terrorists might try to target the UK in the run-up to the election, London's most senior police officer has said.No 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.Other potential targets were the royal wedding and the UK's presidency of the European Union and G8, he said.Tory leader Michael Howard has accused Mr Blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of "using national security for political point scoring".He refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack.He said No 10 did not disclose any security advice they received.Asked about Sir Ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: "We believe the threat is real."

But he said replacing the controversial CSA would be "the nuclear option".Ministers would not rule out scrapping the Child Support Agency if it failed to improve, Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Johnson has warned.The committee said the National Audit Office should investigate why the EDS system had gone so badly wrong.The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the "abandonment option", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work."But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work."The MPs launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up.Theresa May, Tory shadow work and pensions secretary, said: "We have got to find a way that's going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them."The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks.

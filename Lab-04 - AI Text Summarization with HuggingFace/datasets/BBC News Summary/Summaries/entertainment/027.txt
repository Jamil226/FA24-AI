Writer Tony Cowell is among the judges who will hear aspiring writers read their work aloud.The final five will then have to read their work in front of judging panel."It's very, very hard to find an agent and extremely difficult, without an agent, to get a publisher to look at your work," said Cowell.The winner gets a deal with literary agency Curtis Brown.The 2004 winner, Paul Cavanagh, went on to sign a deal with Harper Collins."I'm not going to be the Mr Nasty of books," said Cowell, 54, in reference to his brother's caustic remarks on TV shows Pop Idol and The X-Factor.The winner will be announced at the London Book Fair on 14 March next year and could be screened on TV.

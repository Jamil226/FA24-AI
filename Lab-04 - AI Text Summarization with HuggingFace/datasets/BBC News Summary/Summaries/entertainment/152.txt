Auction spokesman Erik Simon said the Presley tapes were withdrawn because "they did not meet the minimum price set by the owners".And frankly, we could use the money," Mr Nogar's son Stephen, 57, said before the auction.A private collection of six tape recordings of Presley valued at between $30,000 (£16,000) and $50,000 (£27,000) did not meet their reserve price.He said the family of sound engineer Thorne Nogar did not want to divulge the price they had set or the offers they had received.The "pre-masters" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and Mr Nogar."He called them his 'ass-saver' tapes," his son said.

Five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from Fox's schedules, Ms Berman said.Ms Berman said: "I think the audience expects loud things from Fox.Fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season, including the traditionally quiet summer season.Though that had met with a poor reception, Ms Berman said "there's no question that the audience, in our mind, is ready, willing and able to accept new programming in the summer".Fox has changed this plan, launching new shows in May instead of June.One of the new shows will be the animated series American Dad, made by Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy.

British actress Antonia Bernath is making her debut in Kisna - the Warrior Poet, marking a growing trend for non-Indian stars to appear in Bollywood films.Directed by Bollywood veteran Subhash Ghai, the film is set in the British Raj and Bernath plays an army general's daughter who falls in love with a rural boy, Kisna."Bollywood has truly gone global," says Taran Adarsh, editor of Indian film journal Trade Guide.And, many other Bollywood stars have their eyes set on Hollywood.Actor and Producer Aamir Khan's forthcoming venture The Rising is set against the backdrop of the Indian mutiny of 1857, with British actor Toby Stephens in a key role.Kisna has been shot simultaneously in Hindi and English, with the English print shortened by an hour to accommodate the Western audience."Hollywood or Bollywood, it's the box office that determines whether something is a passing phase or a trend," says Adarsh.The cast of Kisna also includes British actors Michael Maloney, Caroline Langrishe and Polly Adams.We improvised quite a lot," says Bernath.I even had a few offers before the work on Kisna was completed."The film even has a song composed in English by AR Rahman, the director of the popular West End musical, Bombay Dreams.Use of European or American actors can be viewed as a step in that direction," says Adarsh.

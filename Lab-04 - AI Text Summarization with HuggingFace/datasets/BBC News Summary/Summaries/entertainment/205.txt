The British producers of US Wife Swap are taking legal action against a show they claim is "a blatant and wholescale copycat" of their programme.ABC bought the rights to the British show, which was first aired in 2003 and became a hit on Channel 4.Earlier this year, the NBC network claimed that Fox's boxing show The Next Great Champ had been hurriedly produced to ensure its programme was the first to be screened.RDF Media, which makes the show for US network ABC, has filed a damages claim for $18 million (Â£9.25 million) against Fox's Trading Spouses.Their show was first screened in June, and was criticised in the press for its similarities to Wife Swap.

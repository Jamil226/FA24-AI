Talk show host Jerry Springer, whose programme inspired the controversial opera shown by the BBC, has said he would not have written it himself."You know, on our TV show if people use inappropriate language we bleep it out, if there's nudity we cover it up, so that viewers at home don't get to see any of this," he said."If I did a show about the war in Iraq, it wouldn't make me a warmonger, I would just be doing my job to report on the war."My show is about dysfunctional people and I defy anyone to watch the show and suggest to me the people on it aren't to some degree dysfunctional."The TV host said he understood how people could have thought the musical had gone too far.Asked whether he thought the BBC should have screened the controversial musical he said: "I don't know if they should have had it on television but, good Lord, if you don't like what's on television, that's why God gave us remote controls.

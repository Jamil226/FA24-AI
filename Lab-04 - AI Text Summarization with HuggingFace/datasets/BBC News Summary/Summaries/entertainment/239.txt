Charlie Simpson took his new band Fightstar to the stage on Friday night, just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band Busted.All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was "devastated" to hear of Simpson's departure.When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, "With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted's sound, but they're still not very inspiring."He was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the University of Warwick.Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: "I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy.While Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted's enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday's press conference coinciding with the start of the band's 13-date tour of the UK.With queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress.Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie's first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick's Student Union - sold out rapidly.

A bookmaker has stopped taking bets on Celebrity Big Brother after claiming "sensitive information" about the Channel 4 show had been leaked.However, a Big Brother spokeswoman was "satisfied" that sensitive information about the show remained confidential.Big Brother's spokeswoman said: "Only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential.William Hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on Friday's surprise double eviction.The bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions, when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1/14.But he added: "They need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information."Bookmaker Ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final, with Kenzie its favourite at 2/9.Mr Adams did not believe anyone from Channel 4 or Big Brother producer Endemol had tried to place the queried bets.But William Hill's "overwhelming evidence" came on Friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the show's surprise double eviction.

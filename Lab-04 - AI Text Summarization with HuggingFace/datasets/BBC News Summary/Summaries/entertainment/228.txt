The life of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis is to be made into a film, it has been announced.The film is to be directed by Dutch-born Anton Corbijn, who has made music movies for Depeche Mode and U2."Film people have a tendency to mess up when they touch music, but I hope this one works.Plans for a separate Joy Division film had been announced at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, but the project did not get off the ground as it failed to get the backing of Curtis's family.Mr Wilson, who was also involved with Joy Division's sucessor band New Order, as well as the Happy Mondays, said he would "rather not" appear in the film.Mr Wilson, who has remained friends with Curtis's widow and daughter Natalie, who he says asked for his involvement to make the film "official".

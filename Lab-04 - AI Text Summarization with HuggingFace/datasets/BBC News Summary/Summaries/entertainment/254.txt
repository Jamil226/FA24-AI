It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain's most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.The Birmingham-born singer, full name Jamelia Davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single So High at 18.His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B.She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man.Superstar was followed by Thank You, winner of best single at the 2004 Mobos, which reached number two in the UK charts.During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself.While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single.R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's Mobo awards.

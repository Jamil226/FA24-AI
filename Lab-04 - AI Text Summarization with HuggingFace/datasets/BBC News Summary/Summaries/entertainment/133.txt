Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (Â£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year's half-time show.Three years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom.Sir Paul McCartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at American football's Super Bowl - and avoided any Janet Jackson-style controversies.Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude.The 62-year-old sang Hey Jude and other Beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in Florida.The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second "Nipple-gate" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.

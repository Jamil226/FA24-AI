Billboard's Hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart.A spokesman for the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) said the first combined UK download and sales chart was due to be compiled "within the first half of this year".Digital music downloads are being included in the main US singles chart for the first time.Download sales are due to be incorporated into the UK singles chart later this year.Its second new chart - the Pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to US radio stations which play chart music.They will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new Hot 100 chart.Digital sales in the US are already used to compile Billboard's Hot Digital Sales chart.

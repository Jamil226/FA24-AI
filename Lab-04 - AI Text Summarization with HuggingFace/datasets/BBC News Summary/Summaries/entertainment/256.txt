And so what of "Urban" music?Urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin?"Urban" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that's where you can call it urban - that's where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from.Stop puting it all in brackets and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.We are urban music as far as I'm concerned.Urban is PC version for saying black music.If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits????Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from.Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.Her music is great soul and surely that is under the 'Urban' banner?Excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely?She did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music.Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music.I don't feel like urban music's just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there's an urban music scene because it's all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.It's music, you like it or you don't.The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it's wrong.A type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.The great thing about urban music is that there's a big range.Urban is just a word that's come about recently to describe "black" music that's become popular now.Black people should lead the music they invented .Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider 'music of black origin', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity.Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music.You have said it: there is music you like and music you don't like - who cares what label you put on it?The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black?The very term 'Music of Black Origin' has confused and offended many people.What urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards.All this "urban" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.The music industry isn't championing music from our particular genre very well anyway.The term 'urban' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first 'black' or 'white' thereby rendering the issue colourblind.It appears that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable.If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim  She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year.The term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards.Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing?It's a word that's been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music.Joss Stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards.If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren't nominated or didn't win.In truth it's a lazy term to categorise music that you don't really understand.If people want to call it urban, why not?Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.Why does music have to be put into a genre?Music made in the inner cities?Whilst I agree that the term 'urban' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won.So, what you're saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn't black.I love Joss to bits and don't care what her branding is - it's amazing music, full stop.If Lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than Joss' work won, he might have said nothing.I'm not really comfortable with the word urban.This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards.There's only two kinds of music: good and bad.I demand a prize for rural music!Urban as a genre is very broad.

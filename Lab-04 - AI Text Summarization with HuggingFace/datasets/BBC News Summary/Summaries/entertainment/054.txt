The release of a film about the Mumbai (Bombay) blasts in 1993 has been postponed following protests by those on trial for the bombings.But 36 people accused in connection with the blasts said it should not be screened until the trial is over.Their lawyer, Majeed Memon, said: "We had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth?Director Anurag Kashyap said the film's release should not be delayed as the book has already been on sale for two years.Investigating the blasts which killed more than 250 people and wounded 1,000, the film Black Friday had been due to open across India on Friday.This is the second time that those accused in connection with the blasts have sought legal intervention regarding the film.

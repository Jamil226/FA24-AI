The prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers.Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: "I just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache."Martin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans' shop, said he thought it was a great idea.Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £350 for the print.He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making."We'll stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that," said Evans.They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there."Why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it," said Mr Hellewell.Broadcaster Chris Evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in Camden Market, London.I thought it was just a load of junk.The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size."Isn't it great" was the comment on the £1,950 throne and "Bob Dylan's old sofa - honest" was written on a dark wood couch priced £4,250.Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom.Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.

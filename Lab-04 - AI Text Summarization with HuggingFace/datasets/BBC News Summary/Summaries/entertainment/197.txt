The permanent replacement for late DJ John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show goes on air on Tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter's slot.Rob Da Bank is one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music.Radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the "challenge" of "keeping his legacy alive" with unpredictable music.Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name.Everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary John Peel.The whole glory of John Peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre.Very good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace John Peel.Rock DJ Huw Stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every Tuesday, with black music champion Ras Kwame on Wednesdays and dance DJ Rob Da Bank on Thursdays.Good luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so it's probably a good idea to get them all contributing.Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales.

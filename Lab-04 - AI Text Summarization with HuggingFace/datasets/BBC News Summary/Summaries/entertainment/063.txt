Last November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals.French film A Very Long Engagement has received 12 nominations for France's Cesar film awards, despite a recent ruling it was "not French enough".Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin's Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche's L'Esquive and France's number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus.The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes.But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete.The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations.

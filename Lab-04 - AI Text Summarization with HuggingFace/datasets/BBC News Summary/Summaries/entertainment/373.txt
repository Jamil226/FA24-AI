Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, was also up for The Phantom of the Opera but lost to The Aviator.It was also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who played abortionist Vera Drake in Mike Leigh's film.Despite three nominations, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star Imelda Staunton.A spokesman for the UK Film Council said: "It is disappointing not to have more British winners."Winslet said she was "ecstatic" about the fourth Oscar nomination of her career, this time for her lead role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.He added: "It was extraordinary to have 24 British nominees in the initial list of nominees."Arnold, who presented children's television shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, said it was "totally overwhelming" to win.Earlier British costume designer Sandy Powell won the Oscar for The Aviator, beating Finding Neverland's UK designer Alexandra Byrne in the process.British hopes of winning major Oscars were dashed as UK stars failed to win acting and directing prizes.Finding Neverland garnered another nomination for British talent, with Gemma Jackson shortlisted for the art direction prize.

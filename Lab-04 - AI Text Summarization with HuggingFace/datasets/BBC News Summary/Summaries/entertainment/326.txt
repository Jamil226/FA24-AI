While he said the Oscar voting panel were not "snubbing" Moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category."Hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language," he said.But Mr Dams said: "It's not an inflammatory film.Another 'contentious' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm."They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious," he said.The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category.Mr Dams said: "It's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced.The film has been a hit around the world.The problem with Mel Gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.It has done very well in Germany, and it's a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster."If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.

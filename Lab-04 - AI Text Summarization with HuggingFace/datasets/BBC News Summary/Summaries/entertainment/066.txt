Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year.Ticket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002's all-time high.Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices.Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.Jeff Blake said: "We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge."

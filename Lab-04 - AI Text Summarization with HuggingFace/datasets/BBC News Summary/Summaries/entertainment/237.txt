Size, whose New Forms album won the 1997 Mercury Music Prize, said gun use was "nothing to be glamorised".R&B star Beverley Knight said she sang on an anti-gun single after being "haunted" by the fatal 2003 shooting of two teenage girls in Birmingham.Size said he collaborated on the single, which was released on Monday, because he has "a bird's eye view of what's going on".Knight said the scale of the problem became clear to her after the 2003 shootings in Aston, near Knight's Birmingham home.She said she was "horrified" by the deaths of Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17.

A US musicologist has recreated a lost musical score by German composer Johann Sebastian Bach.Joshua Rifkin - a composer and leading interpreter of Bach - has recreated the missing instrumental parts.The work, written for the wedding of a daughter of a German customs official, was missing for 80 years."I could not reconstruct what Bach wrote but I could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like," he said.The instrumental parts were entirely lost except for two recycled movements, a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in Bach's work."Then I thought of palaeontologists, from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur.

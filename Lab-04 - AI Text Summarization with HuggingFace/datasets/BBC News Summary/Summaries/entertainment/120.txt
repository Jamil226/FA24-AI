"Bob was a good player.That was the end of it."The last time I saw him was in London in 1980.Bob was a very driven individual.: "Bob was endlessly optimistic about the way Africa would turn out.It was one of the last dates he did in London."At the risk of stating the obvious, he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest I've ever seen.It was interrupted to do a rehearsal.: Bob was one of the most mesmeric people I've ever had the privilege to work with."By 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world.He was an attacking midfield player.: Well 1981 was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder.: It was always a struggle for him to connect with Black America.I had no sense his career was going to go downhill."We can't speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old.: "The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song - one of the most incredible classics of all time.""He sat down in front of the TV and after 10 minutes it was obvious he wasn't going to move.You realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in.

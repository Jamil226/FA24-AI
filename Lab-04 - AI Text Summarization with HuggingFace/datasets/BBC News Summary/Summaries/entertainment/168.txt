But a spokeswoman for MTV said it was "unfair and inaccurate" to single out MTV for criticism.Brent Bozell, PTC president and conservative activist said: "MTV is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids."It's unfair and inaccurate to paint MTV with that brush of irresponsibility," she said.In its report - MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs and Alcohol - the PTC said it witnessed 3,056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2,881 verbal references to sex.The Parents Television Council (PTC), which monitors violence and sex on TV, said the cable music channel offered the "cheapest form" of programming."Compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults, MTV's programming contains substantially more sex, foul language and violence - and MTV's shows are aimed at children as young as 12.

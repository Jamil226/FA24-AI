Bookmaker William Hill has stopped taking bets on who will be the next James Bond, following a succession of large wagers on actor Dougray Scott.The actor was originally due to make a fifth appearance as Bond, but was released from his contract in 2004.Mr Adams said one punter had placed a bet of Â£870 on the 39-year-old actor at odds of 8-1.A large number of bets on actor Colin Salmon to become the first black James Bond were dismissed as a publicity stunt a month ago.The next Bond film, originally due for release in 2005, has been delayed until 2006 due to Sony's takeover of the MGM studio.Others thought to be in the running include Star Wars actor Ewan McGregor and Australian star Hugh Jackman, both of whom have odds of 4-1.

The report said the Freeview digital service has had an "impressive" take up since its launch but the BBC must still dispel confusion about the service.The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen.The call was made in a report into the BBC's Freeview digital service.A BBC spokeswoman said: "We share the committee's interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well."Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money," said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh.The Public Accounts Committee called for the National Audit Office to be given a "free hand" to investigate how the BBC offers value for money.The committee found the BBC had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002.

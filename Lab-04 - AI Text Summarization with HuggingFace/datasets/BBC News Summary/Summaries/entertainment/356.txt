"Ossie was my hero, and he still is," said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years.Hollywood stars including Spike Lee, Burt Reynolds and Oscar nominee Alan Alda have paid tribute to actor Ossie Davis at a funeral in New York.Veteran star Ossie Davis, a well-known civil rights activist, died in Miami at the age of 87 on 4 February 2005."Ossie was a thing of beauty.""It is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom, his humour, his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought," said Belafonte, himself an ardent civil rights activist who had been friends with Davis for over 60 years.Also present at the service was former US president Bill Clinton and singer Harry Belafonte, who gave the eulogy.He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father's funeral."Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes," she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie.

Cidatel Broadcasting said Stern had transformed his show into a "continuous infomercial promoting Sirius, his new satellite radio employer".Stern had been holiday for two weeks but his show did not return to the four stations as expected on 3 January.Controversial DJ Howard Stern has been dropped from four US radio stations because he keeps promoting his move to a network broadcasting on satellite.Viacom has also been hit with record fines of $3.5m (Â£1.8m) over Stern and two other New York DJs.Stern announced in October that he was leaving conventional radio, where his syndicated show goes out across the US, for the relatively restriction-free satellite service.

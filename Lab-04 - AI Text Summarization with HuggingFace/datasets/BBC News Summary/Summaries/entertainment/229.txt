New York electro-rock group The Bravery have come top of the BBC News website's Sound of 2005 poll to find the music scene's most promising new act.Singer Sam Endicott said he felt "great" about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list.Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music's chart show, said the band had "great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound"."The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent," he said.Other new artists in this year's list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third.Elsewhere on the top 10, second-placed rock band Bloc Party began their rise after supporting Franz Ferdinand and UK garage MC Kano, in third, is signed to The Streets' record label.One of the experts to tip The Bravery was The Times' music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were "spiky but in love with pop".Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003.The Bravery, who have been compared to The Cure and New Order, were the most heavily-tipped act in the survey of 110 impartial critics and broadcasters.The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor.

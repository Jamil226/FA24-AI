Last year's Janet Jackson 'wardrobe malfunction' encouraged the FCC to impose tougher rules, but the US Congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines.Entertainers could also be liable for fines under the proposed legisation from both US politcians and officials from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).US politicians are proposing a tough new law aimed at cracking down on indecency and bad language on US TV.The exposure of Janet Jackson's breast at last year's Superbowl landed CBS with a $550,000 (£293,264) fine.The current maximum fine stands at $32,500 (£17,320) - 20 of the stations in the CBS network were each penalised these lesser amounts for the Jackson incident.

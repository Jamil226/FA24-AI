Fans who buy tickets for this year's Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed.More than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event's rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years."There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets," festival organiser Michael Eavis said.The cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged.In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours.But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name.

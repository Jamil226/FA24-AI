Conti's most nerve-wracking moment came during his first Oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke."When the director says 'music' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall.But you don't know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it's exciting," explains Conti.Bill Conti's job of musical director of the Oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment.The orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average Oscars show.So when they say, 'the winner is', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately," adds Conti."Julia Roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do," he says."I have a drink and relive the show," he says.Conti immediately told the show's director: "I start cursing and screaming, I tell him we're not going to die for this show - you must do something or I'm going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we're going to be home in 10 minutes."We don't know who the winners will be."It's a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show.We don't usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off."But there's this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they're either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.""It's a moment in the sun," he says."I have to communicate with the director.When the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual Governor's Ball with his family."No one died, it's not a big story, but it was scary at the time," laughs Conti.The orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show's producers.

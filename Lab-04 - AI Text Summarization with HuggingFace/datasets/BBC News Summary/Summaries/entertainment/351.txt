The study, which claims to be the most in-depth so far conducted, found 60% of women in the film industry hold degrees, compared with 39% of men.It also found that women in the industry were less likely than men to be married or have dependant children.Only 16% of women earn more than Â£50,000, compared with 30% of men.Women in the UK film industry earn less than their male counterparts despite being better qualified, according to a study released on Wednesday.UK Film Council chief executive John Woodward said: "Whilst the UK has benefited hugely from its highly-qualified film production workforce there are still many barriers facing people who want to get in and stay in the industry."Whilst 17% of men in the industry had no qualifications, this was true for only five per cent of women.

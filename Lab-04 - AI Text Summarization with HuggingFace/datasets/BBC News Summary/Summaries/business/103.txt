"Clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in MMC's financial history," Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said.Marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent.An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world's biggest insurer said.The insurer said the cuts were part of a cost-cutting drive, aimed at saving millions of dollars.In an effort to reform its business practises, Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers.As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m.Under the settlement announced in January, Marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the October-to-December quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter.Marsh posted a $676m (£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (£195.3m) profit a year before.

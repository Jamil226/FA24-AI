Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer.But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid.David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a "well funded" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice.Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%.NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times.Mr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times.A spokesman for the supporters club said: "I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than £200m less debt.The board of Man Utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the US tycoon that values the club at £800m ($1.5bn).But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal.

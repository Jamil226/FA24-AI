The rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes.A survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%.A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.IDS said there were some schemes in good health.Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more, IDS said.Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in contributions was "staggering" and the highest ever recorded by IDS.In contrast, between 1996 and 1998, some employers cut their contribution levels.

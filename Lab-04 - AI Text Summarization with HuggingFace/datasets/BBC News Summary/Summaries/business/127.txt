Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to "virtually nothing" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%.Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal.The Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards.The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (Â£15.2bn).While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case.Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep.The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill."We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation," said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep.According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments.

Despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003.And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited.After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco.In the wake of P&O Princess's takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly."The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time," says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion."Carnival has an incredibly strong track record," Mr Champion.In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited.

US retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales.Sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion However, if automotives are excluded from December's data, retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month.Retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US.During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later.But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%.The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (Â£265.9bn).Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added.

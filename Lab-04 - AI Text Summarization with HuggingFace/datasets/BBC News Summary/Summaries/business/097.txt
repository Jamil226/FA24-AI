The US dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was "in America's interest".Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced.US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine.The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November.Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant.A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit.When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners," he said.Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy.Mr Snow's comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.

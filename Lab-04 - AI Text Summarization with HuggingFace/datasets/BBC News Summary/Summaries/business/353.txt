Other countries also are reported to have pledged cash, while the US State Department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region.Other agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank, have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed.Growth has been rapid in southeast Asia, with the World Tourism Organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004."I should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the US," he said.The European Union has said it will deliver 3m euros (£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid, according to the Wall Street Journal.Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch.Tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)."India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country," the WTO said.The EU's Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, Louis Michel, was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid "in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster".Governments, aid agencies, insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia.Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998.December and January are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern Asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump.Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support, while Indonesia, the quake's epicentre, has recently graduated from IMF assistance.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.Tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency."Arrivals to other destinations such as... Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived."Allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability.

The Open Society Institute (OSI), financed by billionaire George Soros, has accused Kazakhstan officials of trying to close down its local office.The OSI shut its office in Moscow last year and has withdrawn from Uzbekistan and Belarus.He has powers for life, while insulting the president and officials has been made a criminal offence."This legal prosecution can be considered an attempt by the government to force Soros Foundation-Kazakhstan to cease its activities in Kazakhstan and shut its doors for Kazakh citizens and organisations," the OSI said.Since the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan has been dominated by its president Nursultan Abish-uly Nazarbayev.The organisation has found itself in trouble after being accused of helping to topple Georgia's former president.

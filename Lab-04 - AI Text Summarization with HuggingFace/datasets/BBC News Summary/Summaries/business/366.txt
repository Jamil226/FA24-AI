Grant Samuel said its valuation of WMC was based on lower average prices for nickel, copper and uranium than current market levels.Last month Australia's competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of WMC by Zurich and London-based Xstrata.He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at "sweetening" its offer.WMC Resources is the world's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium.Australian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; Â£3bn) bid by rival Xstrata.Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid.On Tuesday, WMC chairman Tommie Bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders' best interest to reject the offer.He said WMC would pursue "value-creating options" provided by a portfolio of "world class assets".

A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada."We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005," said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS.The UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes.A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits.But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.

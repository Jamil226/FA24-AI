Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.The Three Gorges Dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China's booming economy.The firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country.Earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam, as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries.Sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier.

The Fed's Open Market Committee - which sets interest rate policy in the US - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise.US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move.The Fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in June, August and September.The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy.The Federal Reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam.In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained "well contained" while the US economy appeared to be "growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices".In a report published on Wednesday, the Bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years."I think the Federal Reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate," said Sung Won Sohn, chief US economist for Wells Fargo Bank.The Bank of England (BoE) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked.Recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the US economy.

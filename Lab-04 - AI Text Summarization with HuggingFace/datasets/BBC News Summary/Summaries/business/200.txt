Fidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy.Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax.A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro's tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture.The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped economy.All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's "convertible" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax.It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government's economic problems.Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives.Cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in Cuba, will be affected.Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity.President Bush's government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba, introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May.The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, Mr Barrionuevo said.Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax, such as euros, or increase their dollar payments to compensate.

In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman."Our nation is in peril here," said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman.Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday.In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost.Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs."It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP," he said.Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m.He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars.Thailand may lose 30bn baht (Â£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome."Calculators will have to wait," said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday.However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.

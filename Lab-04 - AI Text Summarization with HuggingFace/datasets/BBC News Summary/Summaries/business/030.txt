US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said.But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said.Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006.The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD."The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005."If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters," Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report.A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said.

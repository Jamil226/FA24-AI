Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month."Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed," a government minister said earlier on ZDF public television.On Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%.It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs.But the figures are embarrassing for the government.The opposition also made political capital from the figures.

CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had "slowed in recent months in response to rate rises" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future."The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity," he said.The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move."So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing," said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley.It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August.Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium."Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time."

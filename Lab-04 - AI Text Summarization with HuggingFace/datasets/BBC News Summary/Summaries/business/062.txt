To recoup any profit from Wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, Multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors.It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project.Shares in Multiplex Group, which is building the new Wembley stadium, fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project.The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts."It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised."Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added.

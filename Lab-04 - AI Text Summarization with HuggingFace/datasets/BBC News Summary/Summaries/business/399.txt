State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm.India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (Â£1bn).India produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood.India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies.Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US."For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy," said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood.By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim.India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption."We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia," said ONGC chairman Subir Raha.At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees.

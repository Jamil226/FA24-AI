The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline.However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution.The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government.Brazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline.On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992.Earlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week.An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances.

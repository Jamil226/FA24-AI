The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market.The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said.Trade barriers and subsidies "severely" distort the market, the FAO report on the "State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004" said.It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product.According to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice.

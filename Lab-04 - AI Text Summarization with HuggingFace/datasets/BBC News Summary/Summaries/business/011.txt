Ask Jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes.Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week.During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however.Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player.

Bosses of Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange are to meet amid talk that a takeover bid for the LSE will be raised to £1.5bn ($2.9bn).The LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed £1.3bn offer in December, saying it undervalued the business.Last month, the German exchange tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for LSE, valuing it at £1.3bn.Euronext is due to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid.LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE.In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE.

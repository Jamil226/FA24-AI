Vodafone and O2, Britain's other big mobile phone operator, were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year.The European Commission has written to the mobile phone operators Vodafone and T-Mobile to challenge "the high rates" they charge for international roaming.The Commission's investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany."The Commission aims to ensure that European consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the European Union," the Commission said in a statement.Vodafone sent the Commission a response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for a reply.In letters sent to the two companies, the Commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the German mobile phone market.The Vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in Germany.

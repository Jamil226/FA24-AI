The introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature.However, only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary 'chip' technology from all their card providers.Furthermore, 16% said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30% said only some had.New safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments, an anti-fraud agency has said.Retail Decisions chief executive Carl Clump told the BBC that there was "no doubt" that chip and pin would "reduce card fraud in the card-present environment".The introduction of 'chip and pin' cards has tightened security for transactions on the High Street."The main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need," said Mr Clump.But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, Retail Decisions said.

The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid.Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997.While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition."We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid.Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor.The matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia.

But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn.The firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the PC division of personal computer pioneer IBM.Lenovo's profit for the three months to December was HK$327m (US$42m; Â£22m), less than 1% up on the year before.The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market.But investors have been less than impressed with Lenovo's move, designed to take it out of China and further onto the world stage.In any case, margins in PC market are now wafer thin, and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant Dell.

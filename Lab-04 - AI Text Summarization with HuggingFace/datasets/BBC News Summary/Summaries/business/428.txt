Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has recorded its largest single day gain, surging 3.5% to a new high.In 2002, the KSE was the world's best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%.Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE.Then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year.The KSE index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week."Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the market's performance," says Mr Lakhani.One leading Karachi broker said the real reasons may be political.Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions.A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia.Locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market's advantage.Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market.

UK house prices increased by 1.1% in December, the first monthly rise since September, the Halifax has said.The average price of a house in the UK now stands at Â£162,086, Halifax said.The bank said that the recent pattern of house prices rising the fastest in the north of England continued in December."The month by month volatility of the Halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices," a Capital Economics statement said.Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices fell 0.2% in December, with annual inflation running at a three year low.Martin Ellis, Halifax chief economist, said that there was no need to revise the bank's prediction, made last month, that prices would fall by 2% in 2005.The biggest decline was seen in Wales where prices fell by 6.2%, an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004.In the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber, Halifax said prices rose by 3% and 1.2% in the two regions respectively during the month.As a result, annual house price inflation dipped below 20% during the final few months of 2004.

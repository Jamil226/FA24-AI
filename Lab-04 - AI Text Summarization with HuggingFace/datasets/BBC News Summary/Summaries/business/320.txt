There are now 27 countries seeking membership of the WTO.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to hold membership talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan.But several nations criticised the approach, and European Union ambassador to the WTO, Carlo Trojan, said Iran's application "must be treated independently of political issues".Before the process gets under way, all 148 WTO members must give their backing to applicant countries.Membership of the Geneva-based WTO helps guarantee a country's goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation.But Iran's bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US blocked its application for the 21st time.

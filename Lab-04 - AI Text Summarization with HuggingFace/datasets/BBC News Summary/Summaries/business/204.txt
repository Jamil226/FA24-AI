President Bush's proposals would see the Pentagon's budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress, seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit."With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget," he said.The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush's first term.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit.Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the "tightest" so far.Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq."The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes," he said.John McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit.

Children in the UK between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of Â£775, said market analyst Datamonitor.They use "pester power" to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said.According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as "particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines".British children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe - more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests.

Blackwatch's Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in Kirkuk and Baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Mr Hadi points out.But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander.Yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago."It is seen as a selling off of Iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers," she says.The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq.National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq.Mr Hadi's Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future.Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, she explains.Observes Mr Hadi: "The economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector."I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast," Mr Hadi says.The Iraqi business people will do business at all times.Many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way.Mr Hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis.

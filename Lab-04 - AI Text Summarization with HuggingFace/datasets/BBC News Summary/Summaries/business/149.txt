Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car.As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market."We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today," the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe.It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster.Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers.Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers.It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US.

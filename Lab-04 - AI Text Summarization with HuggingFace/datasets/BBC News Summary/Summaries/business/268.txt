Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance.Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives.Interest earned by children is subject to income tax.The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child.There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest.The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent.This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund.Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax.Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free.It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent.This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances.The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase.

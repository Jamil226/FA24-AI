The US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.South Korea, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar.At 1300 GMT, the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar.On Tuesday, traders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session.A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability.Compiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UK's Royal Bank of Scotland, the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings, with 29 cutting back on the US dollar.

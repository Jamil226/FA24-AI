Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos.German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US.Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and "we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again," he said.But the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part.In its filing, Deutsche Bank said Houston was "a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations."Yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of Yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through.It also said the US bankruptcy court should not become involved in "a tax dispute between the Federation and one of its corporate citizens".Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset.

"Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing," the BCC said.The BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004.The outlook for the service sector was "uncertain" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted.The UK manufacturing sector will continue to face "serious challenges" over the next two years, the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has said.However, the BCC found the whole UK economy still faced "major risks" and warned that growth is set to slow.The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said.The rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern.

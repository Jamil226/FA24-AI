Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of Mr Khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues.In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005.In an address to the Majlis, Mr Khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year.Mr Khatami's second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget."Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues," Mr Khatami said.Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment.Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre.

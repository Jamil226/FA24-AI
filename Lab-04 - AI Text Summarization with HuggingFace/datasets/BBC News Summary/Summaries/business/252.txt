"Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT's local network," the former monopoly said in a statement."This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile," a spokesman said."The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world," BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said."BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework," he said.The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors "real equality of access to its phone lines".BT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals."I think it's the first productive thing we've had from BT," he said.To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn."The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT's proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins," director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said."BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field.The scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider," chief executive Lee Strafford said.

The French government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.The support is designed to make French producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry.The French wine industry, the world's second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of New World wines.Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding.A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans.However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for.The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation.Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough.

The Vantage is "the most important car in the history of our company", said Aston's chief executive Ulrich Bez.Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Aston's DB9, which Mr Bez described as "the previous most important car for our company".Mr Bez - himself a former executive at rival Porsche - said the new car was the company's "most affordable car ever and makes the brand accessible".Aston - whose cars were famously used by James Bond - will unveil the Vantage at the Geneva Motor Show on Thursday.

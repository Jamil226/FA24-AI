European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting.It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the "competitiveness of the airlines".The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines.

The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year.However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis."That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1," said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low.Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy.

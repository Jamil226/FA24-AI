Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said it was very unlikely that the Bank of England would put rates up again this time around.UK interest rates are set to remain on hold at 4.75% following the latest meeting of the Bank of England.The Bank's rate-setting committee has put up rates five times in the past year but rates have been on hold since September amid signs of a slowdown.However, Mr Jeffrey said he believed the slowdown in economic activity was temporary and it was dangerous to assume that rates had peaked."I still think interest rates are going up," he said.

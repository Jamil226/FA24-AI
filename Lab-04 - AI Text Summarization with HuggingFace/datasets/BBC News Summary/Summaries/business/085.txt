Mortgage lending rose by £7.1bn in December, up from a £6.4bn rise in November.Changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in November, thus flattering the December figures, analysts said."The modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in December reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply," said Global Insight analyst Howard Archer, commenting on the BoE's figures.Separately, the Bank of England said that consumer credit rose by £1.5bn in December, more than the £1.4bn expected and above the £1.4bn reported in the previous month.

In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a "preliminary approach", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer.A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down.No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club.Mr Glazer owns 28.1%.The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer.That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed "not... in the best interests of the company" by Manchester United's board when they rejected his approach last year.At the club's annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board.Supporters' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer's campaign - said it would fight any move."If that's the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead."However, Mr Glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by Â£200m.Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was "utterly crucial"."Mr Glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment.Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003.

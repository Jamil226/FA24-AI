A CBI quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in seven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing expenses.When firms were questioned on output volume, the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - the highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when looking ahead to the next three months.The CBI found some firms managed to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many said increases failed to keep up the rise in costs.The CBI said companies are looking to the government to lessen the regulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold.The CBI also found spending on innovation, training and retraining is forecast to go up over the next year.

Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since March 2003, the quarterly Tankan survey has found."The economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall", the economy minister said.In the Bank of Japan's December survey, the balance of big manufacturers saying business conditions are better, minus those saying they are worse, was 22, down from 26 in September.Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey."It will feel a bit slower (next year) than this year, and growth may be a bit more gentle but the situation is that the recovery will continue," said economy minister Heizo Takenaka.December's confidence level was below that seen in September, the Bank of Japan said.Companies reported they expect to invest 7.7% more in the year to March 2005 than the previous year - up from expectations of 6.1% increase in the September Tankan.

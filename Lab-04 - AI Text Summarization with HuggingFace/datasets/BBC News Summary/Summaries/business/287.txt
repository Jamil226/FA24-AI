Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan, asks; "Who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker?And when it comes to longevity, Japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that.In contrast to Japan - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century."Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary," insists Mr Wood.Mr Toshitsune is one of Japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114.Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power."Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas," says Mr Wood.In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject.Japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US.At his neat Osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%.But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically.Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession.Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone.By 2007, Japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century.But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island.But while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead.Between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: "Well, what's most important for me is to be Japan's number one.""Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders?

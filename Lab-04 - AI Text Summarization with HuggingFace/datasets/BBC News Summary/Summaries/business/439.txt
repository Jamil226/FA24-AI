Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said."If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.""During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong," said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt.The economy contracted in 2003.Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market.

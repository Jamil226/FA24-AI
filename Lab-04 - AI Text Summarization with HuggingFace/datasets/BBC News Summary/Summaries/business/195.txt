Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its "golden rule", a report suggests.A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was "on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond".Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone "is expected to pick up speed"."Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006," NIESR said, adding that "the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery".Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said.According to NIESR, if the government's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is "unlikely" the golden rule will be met.The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects.The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008.

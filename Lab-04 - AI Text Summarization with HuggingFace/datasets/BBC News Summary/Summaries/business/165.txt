US economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, helped by strong consumer spending, official figures have shown.However, President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth.The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said."The economy regained some traction in the third quarter, but the growth is not robust," AG Edwards' Thayer.The figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters.Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US.The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the July to September period, the Commerce Department said.

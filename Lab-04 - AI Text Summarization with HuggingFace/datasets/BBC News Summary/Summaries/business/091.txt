"These improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on Russia," wrote S&P credit analyst Helena Hessel.Instead, with Russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, S&P said the government's own debt is looking a good bet.Soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean Russian debt is no longer a risky investment, one of the world's leading credit rating agencies says.The other two major ratings agencies - Fitch and Moody's have long since upped their rating of Russia's sovereign debt.But the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past.S&P said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk.Standard & Poor's has classed Russian bonds as "investment grade", up from their former "speculative" rating.

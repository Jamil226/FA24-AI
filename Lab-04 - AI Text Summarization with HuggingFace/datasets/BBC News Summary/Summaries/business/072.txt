The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree.The government last year tightened the rules for card lending to keep the card glut under control.Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003.One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers' bad debts.Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year.Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year.

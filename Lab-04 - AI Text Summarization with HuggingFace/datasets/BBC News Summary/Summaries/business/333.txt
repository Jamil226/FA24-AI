The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation.Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market.Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board.Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover.The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks.

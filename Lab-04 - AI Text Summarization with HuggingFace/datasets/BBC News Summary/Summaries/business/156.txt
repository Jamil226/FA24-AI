Industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January from a month earlier.Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan's economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP.With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand.Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January.Within the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown.At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997.

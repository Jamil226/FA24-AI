Russian oil company Yukos has dropped the threat of legal action against five banks it had accused of involvement in the sale of its key Yugansk unit.Yukos says the sale was illegal and is pursuing damages in a US court.However, Yukos still has an outstanding complaint against Deutsche Bank, which it alleges to be the leader of a consortium that was behind a bid for Yugansk by state gas monopoly Gazprom.But Deutsche Bank has suggested Yukos artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset.Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft.

The European Commission (EC) has called a truce in its battle with France and Germany over breaching deficit limits.After announcing its decision to erase France and Germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the EU said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%.The forecasts are based on EC predictions of GDP growth of 1.5% in Germany next year and 2.2% in France.France and Germany will breach that this year."The commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005," it said in a statement.The move came after France and Germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the EU cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years.Under EU rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%.The EU expects the German deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of GDP next year from 3.9% this year, while France's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year.

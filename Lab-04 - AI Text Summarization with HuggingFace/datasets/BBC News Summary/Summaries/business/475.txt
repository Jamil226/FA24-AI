Vivendi has rejected the charge, saying the decision to buy the Cegetel shares was "no more than a possibility, of which the public was perfectly aware" at the time of the bond issue.Vivendi, however, has said that the information was public knowledge as Mr Davis' offer for the US assets had already been rejected by Vivendi's board.French stock market regulator AMF has filed complaints against media giant Vivendi Universal, its boss and another top executive.AMF is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom's shares in Cegetel.It believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information.Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing.

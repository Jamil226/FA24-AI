Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted, saying the default age was not a statutory, compulsory retirement age.But Age Concern said imposing a retirement age of 65 was "cowardly" and a "complete u-turn".Under new European age discrimination rules, a default retirement age of 65 will be introduced.The decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension, the government has said."This makes a mockery of the Government's so-called commitment to outlawing ageism, leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel," said Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern England .Under age discrimination proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished.

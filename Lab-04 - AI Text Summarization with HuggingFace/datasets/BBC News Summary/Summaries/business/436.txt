The ECB has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1.9% in 2005.Borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro, analysts said.ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region, and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005.If anything, there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut, especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar.Inflation in the eurozone, however, is estimated at about 2.3% in December, above ECB guidelines of 2%.The ECB "may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again, they will."

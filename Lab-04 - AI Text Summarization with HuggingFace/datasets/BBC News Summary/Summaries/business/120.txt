The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower."People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy," said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters.Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s.But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970.

Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos.The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk."The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets," said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case.

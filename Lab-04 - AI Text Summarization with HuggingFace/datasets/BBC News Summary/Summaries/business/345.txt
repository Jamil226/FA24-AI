The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit.Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit.World Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is "only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster" and its economic impact.In Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost.Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be "significant", Agence France Presse reported."In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces," said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand."The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005," he said.The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly.Economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004.

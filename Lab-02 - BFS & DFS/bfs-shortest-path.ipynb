        "# **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n",
        "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching through a graph or tree data structure. It explores nodes (vertices) level by level, starting from a given node (often called the root) and expanding outward in all directions. BFS visits all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n",

        "### 1. Queue-Based Traversal\n",
        "BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. Nodes are added to the queue in the order they are discovered, and the algorithm processes nodes one by one from the front of the queue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Level-Order Exploration\n",
        "BFS explores all neighbors (adjacent nodes) of the current node before moving on to the next level. It ensures that the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) is found in an unweighted graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Graph Representation\n",
        "BFS can be applied to graphs or trees. A graph is made up of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges (links between nodes). The graph can be represented using an adjacency list, an adjacency matrix, or other data structures.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue the current node, and for each of its unvisited neighbors, add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all reachable nodes have been visited or until you find the desired node (for pathfinding problems).\n",

        "BFS can be used to find all the nodes connected to a specific node in a graph.\n",

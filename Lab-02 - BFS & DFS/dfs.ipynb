        "# **Depth-First Search (DFS)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**DFS** is a fundamental algorithm used for traversing or searching through data structures like trees and graphs. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Traversal Strategy**\n",
        "   - DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means it goes deep into one path of the graph until it cannot go further, then it backtracks to explore other paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **How It Works**\n",
        "   - **Start at a Node**: Begin the search from a specified starting node.\n",
        "   - **Mark as Visited**: Keep track of which nodes have been visited to avoid processing the same node multiple times.\n",
        "   - **Explore Neighbors**: Visit one unvisited neighbor of the current node, mark it as visited, and repeat the process.\n",
        "   - **Backtrack**: If there are no unvisited neighbors, backtrack to the previous node and continue exploring until all reachable nodes have been visited.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Structure**\n",
        "   - DFS can be implemented using stack data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Applications**:\n",
        "   - Finding connected components in a graph\n",
        "   - Solving puzzles (e.g., mazes,etc.)\n",
        "   - Pathfinding algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Example**:\n",
        "   - Graphical Representation\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "         A\n",
        "        / \\\n",
        "       B   C\n",
        "      / \\   \\\n",
        "     D   E   F\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - Starting from node `A`, the DFS traversal could visit nodes in the order: `A -> B -> D -> E -> C -> F`"
